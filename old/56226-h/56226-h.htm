<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "How we laughed as we laboured together!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How well I remember, to-day,<br />
  Our 'outings' in midsummer weather,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our winter delights at the play!<br />
  We were not over-nice in our dinners;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 'rooms' were up rickety stairs;<br />
  But if hope be the wealth of beginners,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Jove, we were all millionaires!<br />
  Our incomes were very uncertain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prospects were equally vague;<br />
  Yet the persons I pity who know not the city,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful city of Prague!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If you can imagine the lonely shade of the man
who wrote that verse returning to Literary
London&mdash;where there is no longer a young man who
could write it, and merely a few greybeards are
left still to understand what it means&mdash;I say, if
you can imagine this, you may appreciate the
condition of Conrad when he went back to the
Quartier Latin.
</p>

<p>
Conrad was no less sad, his disappointment was
no less bitter, the society that he had sought so
eagerly was no less alien to him.  But while he
commanded bocks for all, and mourned the change
that left him desolate, the melancholy of his mood
was a subtler thing&mdash;for he realised that the
profoundest change was in himself.
</p>

<p>
Something should be said of the longings that
had brought him back to the Quarter&mdash;longings
in one hour tender, and in the next
tempestuous&mdash;something hinted of the regretful years during
which his limbs reposed in an official chair while
his mind flew out of the official window to places
across the sea where he had been young, and
sanguine, and infinitely glad.  To a score of places it
flew, but to none perhaps so often as Paris, where
he had studied art in the days when he meant to
move the world.
</p>

<p>
Of course the trouble with the man was that
he wanted to be nineteen again, and didn't
recognise it.  We do not immediately recognise that
our youth is going from us; it recedes stealthily,
like our hair.  For a long time he had missed the
zest, the sparkle, the buoyancy from life, but for
the flatness that distressed him he blamed the
Colony instead of his age.  He confused the emotions
of his youth with the scenes where he had felt
them, and yearned to make sentimental journeys,
fancying that to revisit the scenes would be to
recover the emotions.
</p>

<p>
Because the office rewarded his mental flights
ungenerously he was restrained by one of those
little realities which vulgar novelists observe and
which are so out of place in novels&mdash;"sordid"
considerations, like ways and means.  Give us lots
of Blood, and the dummy over the dashing highwayman's
shoulder!  If you call him a "cavalier"
it's Breezy Romance.
</p>

<p>
And then his Aunt Tryphena died, and left him
everything.
</p>

<p>
At once he was lord of himself.  Liberated by
"everything," he sailed for Home, and savouring
the knowledge that he was free to rove where he
listed, lingered in London.  Some months
afterwards&mdash;when the crocuses were perking behind
the Park rails, and Piccadilly was abloom with the
first millinery of spring&mdash;he travelled to Dover,
en route for the Past.
</p>

<p>
And lilac was everywhere&mdash;Paris was all lilac
and sunshine.  He drove to an hotel on the left
bank.  To behold it again!  The grotesque clock
under the glass shade, and the clothes pegs that
were too large to hang clothes on, the scarlet
édredon that he would throw on the floor before
he got into bed, the sight of these things was sweet
to him as the welcome of a woman is sweet after
a passage made on a slow steamer to reach her
side.
</p>

<p>
He said to the femme de chambre&mdash;she was
elderly and she was plain; pretty chambermaids
are all employed in farcical comedies; but she
was a femme de chambre, and he felt communicative.
He said, "La dernière fois que j'étais
Paris, j'étais un gamin."  She smiled and gave a
shrug: "Monsieur n'est qu'un enfant aujourd'hui."  What
English servant would have earned that
tip? ... Oh, yes!  English servants are all too
truthful.
</p>

<p>
When he had scattered his things about the
room, he strode out to seek the little restaurant
where the dinners had been so good, and the
company had been so witty years before.  Well, it had
vanished.  Perhaps he wasn't surprised, but he
loitered wistfully in the street from which the
faded sign had gone, and at the flashy establishment
where he dined instead, the plats lacked
flavour.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by he sauntered along the Boul' Mich'.
While he walked he perceived that he had ceased
to look about him, and was again looking back.
The sigh of names that had been long forgotten
was in the plaintive night, and the air was thick
with echoes.  He moved along the lamp-lit boulevard
seeing ghosts, and to right and left the heedless
faces of the fleshly crowd were strange to him.
All strange to him.  This was the first impediment
in his road.
</p>

<p>
"Gay Paree" is gayest in the doggerel of the
English music-halls; its gaiety is declining fast,
but its beauty is fadeless.  No city goes to bed
more worldly, and wakes up looking more innocent.
At six o'clock next day, when they began to
beat carpets, and Conrad flung the windows wide,
some of the happiness of the wakened capital's
simplicity was breathed into his heart.  And his
fervour, and his purse, overcame the first impediment.
Within a week of his arrival he had already
been called "Mon cher."
</p>

<p>
He was called "Mon cher," and other things.
He puffed his "caporal" at the Café Vachette,
and found that he had lost his relish for French
tobacco; he sat among the cards and the
dominoes at the Café d'Harcourt&mdash;bought carnations
and écrevisses from the pedlars' baskets for
Angèle and Suzanne; and Angèle and Suzanne
proved witless compared with what their mothers
had been, and he noted&mdash;not without some slight
pride, for we are all patriotic abroad&mdash;that
though the art of tying a veil has been granted
to French women, the pretty features have been
granted to the English.
</p>

<p>
It was now that the disappointment fell, now
that he cried:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh for one hour of youthful joy!<br />
  Give back my twentieth spring!'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The ardour of the students left him chilly, the
rodomontades of his compatriots sounded merely
stupid.  They were all going to sacrifice themselves
for an ideal, all going to England to paint
persistently the class of work that England did
not want.  "No concessions" was their battle
cry.  Youth can never believe that it will live to
make concessions.  Your adept finds nowhere so
scathing a critic as your novice.
</p>

<p>
O beautiful time when he, too, had imagined he
was born with a mission!  Bright morning when
he had vapoured with the vainest!  This afternoon
the Rapsodie Anglaise was played to duller ears.
The freaks seemed joyless, and he said the
aspirations were "out of drawing."  He was not sure
that it was of immense importance whether one
painted well, or ill&mdash;whether one painted at all.
There were more useful things to be done in the
world.  He did not wish to do them, but he
suggested that they were there.  Then the audience
hurled passages from the preface to "Mademoiselle
de Maupin" at him&mdash;without acknowledgment&mdash;pelting
him with the paragraphs full of
shoes and potatoes until he was dizzy, and
perhaps a little shaken.  After all, when one has
failed to pluck the grapes it is easy to proclaim
that potatoes are more nourishing.  On the whole
he was scarcely a success in the Quarter&mdash;a
success of curiosity at most&mdash;and he won no converts
to his theory (advanced in the Soleil D'Or)
that the greatest services to modern art were
rendered by the writers of ladies' fashion articles.
</p>

<p>
"They are the Teachers who make the widest
school," he urged.  "Under their influence the
fairest work of Nature takes an added loveliness.
To them we owe the enticements of the tea-gown,
the soul-compelling whisper of the silk petticoat.
What other apostle of Beauty can hope to shed
beauty in every home?  Into how many homes
do you suppose your ballades will go?"  He was
chatting to a poet.  But the poet became diffuse.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Conrad returned to his hotel not wholly dissatisfied
with the impression he had made upon the
poet.  In la Rue du Haut-Pavé he had one or two
vigorous thoughts concerning the vanity of
versification which he wished had occurred to him in
the cabaret, and when he had lit the lamp he began
to write.  You can know very little about him if
you are surprised to be told that what he wrote
was verse.  It was of course a monody to his
Boyhood.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As his age has not been stated, and he had
begun to deplore it so much, it may be as well at
this point to say that he was thirty-seven.  A less
venerable figure than you have pictured him,
perhaps, despite the chambermaid.  There were,
however, hours when he felt a hundred.
</p>

<p>
He felt a hundred towards the close of his stay
in Paris.  He had resolved to go back to London,
but it had few associations for him, and he packed
his portmanteaux drearily.  On the evening before
he crossed, his thoughts flashed to a little English
watering-place where he had spent a summer when
he was still proud of wearing trousers.  He recalled
the moment of his invitation, the thrill of its
unexpectedness.  A nursery, and four children:
three of them his cousins, departing for the
seaside next day, in fancy already on the sands.  And
one of the trio had exclaimed&mdash;was it Ted
who began it?&mdash;one of the trio had exclaimed:
"Wouldn't it be jolly if Con could come too?"  He
was "Con."  He was Con hanging over the
banisters breathless five minutes later, for Nina,
and 'Gina, and Ted had descended to the drawing-room
tumultuously to prefer a petition to "Ma."
</p>

<p>
"Ma says there wouldn't be beds enough,"
they announced with long faces, mounting the
stairs; and then he stammered that he had
"expected there'd be something like that," and they
danced round him in a ring, crying: "We made
it up.  You're to come with us if you
may&mdash;you're to go home and ask."
</p>

<p>
The nursery was very clear to him.  He saw the
gleeful group on the threshold again, and the
bright pattern of the wall-paper.  He could see
the open window with the radiant sky across the
roofs.
</p>

<p>
So they had all gone to the seaside together&mdash;he,
and Nina, and 'Gina, and Ted, in charge of
the governess; and the house had turned out to
be a school called "Mowbray Lodge," but the
boys were away.  Jack, the dog, had been lost
on the journey&mdash;and killed the schoolmaster's
chickens when he was restored.  The rows there
used to be with the master!  Mr. Boultbee, that
was his name.  There was a yellow field blazing
with dandelions, Conrad remembered, and behind
the shadow of the fir trees, apples swayed.  He
remembered the garden of Rose Villa next door,
and the afternoon when Mary Page kissed her
hand over the fence.  Mary Page!  On a sudden
how close it was&mdash;all except her features&mdash;her
hat trimmed with blue, and her dangling plaits,
and the vibration of the time.  Ted and he were
enslaved by her equally&mdash;without bitterness&mdash;and
used to show each other the love-letters she
wrote to them both after they went home.  And
oh! how they longed to be back, and oh, the plans
they made, which never fructified, for husbanding
their pocket-money and taking her by surprise one
brilliant morning!
</p>

<p>
"Qu'est-ce que vous m'offrez, monsieur?
Payez-moi un bock, hein?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Conrad, starting, "run along and
play, there's a good child!"  These memories
had come to him at the Bal Bullier, and the band
was banging, and the petticoats were whirling, and
a young lady was asking to be refreshed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
She pouted a protest at him, and whisked into the
dance.  He observed that she had graces, and
heaved a sigh for the time when it would have
been piquant to brush the pout away.  To-night it
would be tasteless.  "Kissing a cocotte is like
eating tinned salmon," said Conrad to himself
regretfully, and went to the vestiaire for his
overcoat.
</p>

<p>
The interruption had jarred him, but it was not
until the Closerie des Lilas was a hundred yards
behind that he knew he had left the hall for the
purpose of resuming his reverie in comfort.  When
he reached the Boulevard Saint-Michel his interest
in the projects of five-and-twenty years ago was
again so keen that he grieved to think they had
been fruitless.  Improving on history, he permitted
the boys who were boys no more to amass the
sovereign that they coveted, and, giving his fancy
rein, lived through the glorious day which had
never dawned.  He tried very hard to be fair to
Ted after Mary had welcomed them, though to
prevent the conversation becoming a dualogue
irked him a good deal.  In moments he discovered
that he was talking to her rather well for his age,
and then he corrected himself with loving artistry.
But he could seldom find it in his heart to correct
Mary, and she said the prettiest things in the
world.  He came back to the present, swimming
with tenderness for the little maiden of his
retrospect.  It shocked him to reflect that she must be
about thirty-eight if she lived still, and might even
have a marriageable daughter.  The pathos of the
marriageable daughter indeed overwhelmed him,
and, taking a seat at the Taverne du Panthéon, he
pictured himself waking to realise that he was only
twelve years old and that all events subsequent to
the epoch had been a dream.
</p>

<p>
The October air was bleak when he crossed on
the morrow, and the deck rolled to meet the
splashes of the waves.  The idea of revisiting the
watering-place&mdash;and the idea had germinated&mdash;attracted
him less forcibly as his chair played see-saw
with the taffrail, but he remembered that he
had often been advised by advertisements "not to
risk infection from foreigners, when he could
winter in sunny Sweetbay, the fairest spot in
England."  The fact that it had a reputation as a
winter resort encouraged him somewhat, and by
the time he saw the lamps of Charing Cross he
felt adventurous again.  He also admired a girl
on the platform.  "There's nothing like an
Englishwoman for beauty," he said; and the girl
exclaimed: "Oh, I've left my little fur in my
grip, right there!"
</p>

<p>
He fulfilled his programme the next morning.
The drowsy station of Sweetbay seemed to him
larger than of yore as he glanced about him, but
he did not stop to gather information in the
matter.  His bag was in the fly, and he was
rattled to an hotel where the manager appeared
surprised to see him.  Although his sensations
on the boat had left him with no insistent longing
for a room with a sea-view, he accepted one
without complaint, and learning that luncheon was
being served, descended to where three
despondent-looking visitors were scattered among an acre
of tables.  Evidently people continued to go
abroad in spite of the advice.  However, he had
not come to Sweetbay for society.
</p>

<p>
It was a neat and decorous little town awaiting
him when he sallied forth from the hotel.
Everything was very clean, very tidy.  The pink-paved
sidewalks, bordered by trees, glistened like coral;
the snug villas, enclosed by euonymus hedges
trimmed to precision, had a fresh and wholesome
air, an air that made him think of honey soap and
good rice puddings.  He backed before the walls
of the Parish Church.  A play-bill of the Rosery
Theatre, near by, seemed an anachronism, and
even as he recalled Sweetbay it had been content
with Assembly Rooms.  On a hoarding he saw a
poster of the Pier Pavilion&mdash;the pavilion was an
innovation too.  In the High Street photographs
of some popular actors had invaded a shop
window, and he was struck by the extraordinary
resemblance they bore to one another&mdash;all
wearing on the brow the frown of intellectuality, and
carefully disordered hair.  The Town Hall was a
landmark.  He murmured Matthew Arnold's line:
"Expressive merely of the impotence of the
architect to express anything," but the unparalleled
ugliness of the building warmed him with
recollections.  He branched to the left, as he used to
branch to the left when he carried Mary's bathing
shoes, and surrendering himself to sentiment
unreservedly now swung joyously for Eden.
</p>

<p>
And from this point landmarks flocked thick
and fast.  The way began to climb the hill, the
hill began to show the boughs, the boughs began
to veil the road, the road began to woo the lane,
the lane began to near the house, and&mdash;like the
old woman's pig&mdash;Conrad got over the stile.
</p>

<p>
And "Mowbray Lodge" was still painted on
the gate!  It was all so wonderfully the same for
a moment in the shade behind the fir trees&mdash;so
wonderfully&mdash;that he felt tearful.  The scene
had stood so still that there seemed something
unreal in his returning here a man.  Again he saw
the slender columns of the long veranda, and
the summer-house on which the weather-cock still
perched.  He looked, and looked wide-eyed, at a
faded door&mdash;not green, not blue&mdash;and knew
suddenly that behind that door there should be
currant bushes and a tangle of nasturtium, and
hens prinking on the path.  His soul embraced
the scene.  And yet&mdash;and yet it was not the
features which had lived in his mind that moved
him most.  The magic lay in the pervasive hush,
and in a gust of the fir trees' smell, which he had
forgotten until it swept him breathless across the
years.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there seemed something unreal in his
standing here a man.  His spirit was listening&mdash;and
he knew that it was listening&mdash;for calls from
children who had grown to middle-age now; his
gaze was waiting&mdash;even he knew that it was
waiting&mdash;for the rush of childish figures which the
scene should yield.
</p>

<p>
Presently he sought the space where they had
played.  But the Field of the Cloth of Gold was
transformed.  Where the dandelions had spread
their splendour for Mary he saw a market-garden,
and the sun that had made a halo for Mary
glittered on glass.  There was a quantity of glass,
there were consequential rows of it, all raising
money for somebody, all reminding the pilgrim
that meadows move with the times.  "Well, I
suppose it's progress," said Conrad, shaking his
head.  But he missed the dandelions.  He was a
Conservative by instinct, though he was a Liberal
by reason.
</p>

<p>
When he loitered back to the view of Mowbray
Lodge, a lady of the age which it is gallant
to call "uncertain" had come out on the veranda.
She had a little shawl over her shoulders, and in
her hand she held a pair of scissors with which
she was clipping a palm.  The placid gaze she
lifted to him was not discouraging, and advancing
towards her with a bow he said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pray forgive me for troubling you, but may
I ask if Mr. Boultbee lives here now?"
</p>

<p>
"N&mdash;no," answered the lady pensively, "no
gentleman lives here.  'Mr. Boultbee'?  I'm
afraid I don't know the name.  Are you sure he
is still living in the town?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure of nothing," replied Conrad.  "It
is so long since my last visit that I am even
doubtful if he is living at all."
</p>

<p>
She seemed to reflect again and said: "Perhaps
they might be able to tell you at the post-office."
</p>

<p>
"It really isn't important," he declared,
"though I'm obliged by your suggestion.  To
confess the truth, I am more drawn to the garden
than to Mr. Boultbee.  Years ago I spent a
summer here, and being in the neighbourhood
again I couldn't resist the temptation to come
and dream over the top rail of your gate."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;would you care to look round the
place?" she murmured with a tentative wave of
the scissors.
</p>

<p>
"I should be charmed," said Conrad, "if I
am not intruding."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you don't see it to advantage now.
Last month&mdash;"  She moved across the lawn
beside him, telling the falsehoods with which
everybody who has a garden always dejects a
visitor.  He affected that thirst for knowledge
with which everybody who is shown a garden
always rewards a host.
</p>

<p>
"It's a long time since you were here, I
think you said?" she remarked, pleased by his
eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"It is," said Conrad, in his most Byronic
manner, "just a quarter of a century."  The lady
looked startled, and he continued with a sigh,
"Yes, I was then in that exquisitely happy period
of life when we just begin to know that we are
happy; you may imagine what memories are
stirring in me:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'I can recall, nay, they are present still,<br />
  Parts of myself, the perfume of my mind,<br />
  Days that seem farther off than Homer's now<br />
  Ere yet the child had loudened to the boy' ...<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
That poem&mdash;Lowell's 'The Cathedral'&mdash;flashed
into my mind as I came upon your parish
church awhile ago, and
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'gazed abashed,<br />
  Child of an age that lectures, not creates,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
at its old honours.  I quoted the best part of a
stanza to myself in the street.  I'm afraid that is
a habit of mine."
</p>

<p>
"It must be very nice," said the lady apprehensively;
"yes, indeed."
</p>

<p>
It appeared that she was no more acquainted
with Lowell than with Mr. Boultbee, so gliding
to a subject which lay quite near his heart this
afternoon he introduced a third name.
</p>

<p>
"When I was here last a Dr. Page occupied the
villa across the fence," he went on.  "He had a
daughter.  To be prolix, he had several daughters,
but to me his family consisted of Miss Mary.
We were engaged.  I won't ask you if they are
there still&mdash;something warns me that they are
not&mdash;but can you, by any chance, give me news
of them?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry I cannot," she returned, fluttering.
"There has been no Dr. Page in Sweetbay&mdash;I
am almost certain there has been no Dr. Page in
Sweetbay since I settled here.  I am positive there
is none now&mdash;quite positive.  There's Dr. Hunt,
there's Dr. Tatham&mdash;"  She recounted laboriously
the names of all the medical men practising
about the town, while he wondered what she was
doing it for.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you heartily," he said, when she
reached the end of the list.
</p>

<p>
The next moment it became evident that she,
in her turn, had a question to put, for her glance
was interrogating him already, and at last she
faltered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Pardon my asking you, but did I understand
you to say that you were&mdash;h'm&mdash;engaged to
the daughter of Dr. Page twenty-five years ago?
Surely when you said you were a child then, it was
no figure of speech?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Conrad; "but to be frank
with you, it was nothing less than the thought of
her that lured me back to-day.  Let me admit that
I wasn't quite ingenuous when I spoke of&mdash;of
'being' in the neighbourhood; I came deliberately,
in fulfilment of a cherished plan.  To me
your garden is a tomb&mdash;if I may say so without
depressing you&mdash;it is the tomb of the Used-to-be.
We were both children, but there are some things
that one never forgets:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'I'm not a chicken; I have seen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a chill September,<br />
  And though I was a youngster then,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That girl I well remember.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Holmes wrote 'gale,' not 'girl,' otherwise he
might have been speaking for me."
</p>

<p>
"Such constancy is very beautiful," breathed the
lady; "I thought&mdash;"  She paused, slightly pink.
</p>

<p>
"But it was unfair," he assured her; "men can
be quite as constant as women&mdash;especially to
the women they never won."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;perhaps you would like to see the
house?" she inquired; "and you will allow me to
offer you some tea before you go?"
</p>

<p>
"I accept both offers gratefully," said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
He followed her into the hall, and she conducted
him, with little prefatory murmurs, to such of the
apartments as a maiden lady might modestly
display.  Repapered and rearranged they looked
quite strange to him, but the knowledge that he
was in Mowbray Lodge averted boredom.
</p>

<p>
"You find them altered," she said, as they went
back to the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Improved," said he.
</p>

<p>
"And the town," she added; "no doubt you
find the town improved too?"
</p>

<p>
"Altered," said Conrad, thinking of the market
garden.  "Well, it is certainly bigger."
</p>

<p>
"The rapid development of Sweetbay can
astonish none who bear in mind its remarkable
combination of climatic advantages, but the sylvan
fairness of the town is not diminished, and it
continues to present an unrivalled example of the
'rus in urbe,'" responded the lady with surprising
fluency.  "Do you take sugar and milk?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;thank you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Are you making a long stay among us, or&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"A very brief one.  Indeed, I thought of
returning to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  There was a tinge of disappointment
in her "Oh."  "I wondered if you meant to stop.
If you had meant to pass the winter here&mdash;  But
I daresay you would have preferred an hotel
anyhow?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," he said, sipping.  "What
is it you were going to be good enough to
suggest?"
</p>

<p>
"It occurred to me that, as the house has so
many associations for you, you might have liked
to take it for a short term.  I am trying to let it
furnished during the next few months, and I could
leave the servants.  My cook has been with me
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You would let this house to me?" exclaimed
Conrad, thrilling, and saw such splendid visions
that for quite a minute he forgot to attend to her.
</p>

<p>
"If the rent is too high&mdash;?"  She was regarding
him nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," he cried, "not at all.  I was
simply lost in the effulgent prospect that you've
opened to me."
</p>

<p>
"Really?"
</p>

<p>
"It was an inspiration.  How kind of you to
mention it."
</p>

<p>
She deprecated gratitude.  "There would be
no children, of course?" she said, her gaze
dwelling among her china.
</p>

<p>
"Four," he answered promptly.  "That is,
the youngest must be about thirty-five now.  I beg
your pardon, but <i>I</i> have had an inspiration, too,
I'm dazzled by the idea of peopling the house
with the men and women who were children here
five-and-twenty years ago; I dare swear my relatives
have never set foot in Sweetbay since.  We'll
be comrades all over again&mdash;  You know how
Time loosens these childish ties&mdash;in the very
place, in the very rooms, where we were such
comrades then.  Why, it's the most delightful plan
that was ever hatched!"  He hesitated.  "I
wonder if they'll come?  How about the trains?
One of my cousins would have to go up rather
often, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"The railway company has combined with
Mother Nature and a spirited Corporation to
render Sweetbay attractive to the jaded Londoner.
The service is fast and frequent, and well-appointed
'flys' may be chartered at most reasonable
fares," replied his hostess without an instant's
pause.
</p>

<p>
"How convenient!" said Conrad.  "What
more can he want?"
</p>

<p>
"If you think your friends may need persuasion,
I should be pleased to present you with a copy
of a little work of mine to send them.  It
describes all the attractions of the neighbourhood&mdash;and
it's quite unlike the usual guide-book.  It is
thorough, but chatty.  My aim has been to inform
the visitor in a sprightly way."
</p>

<p>
"An authoress?" he said warmly.
</p>

<p>
"Of one book only," she murmured, her face
suffused by an unbecoming blush.
</p>

<p>
"But of many readers, I'll be bound!  If
obstacles arise then, it shall be your pen that
conquers them.  You overwhelm me with kindnesses.
I really think, though, the address will be magnet
enough for the friends I want.  'Mowbray Lodge,
Sweetbay'&mdash;how they'll stare!  'Bring your
spades and pails,' I shall write; 'come, and let us
all be boys and girls again.'  The girls have little
girls and boys of their own now.  No, don't be
afraid of their smashing that soul-stirring Chelsea,
my dear madam&mdash;I won't have them.  That's
the essence of the contract, the new generation
must be left behind.  There must be we four, and
nobody else&mdash;the four who will find their childhood
waiting for them here, just the four who can
feel the enchantment of Mowbray Lodge.  So
it is settled?"
</p>

<p>
"As far as&mdash;"  She smoothed her gown.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, naturally there must be references, and
inventories, and all sorts of tiresome details&mdash;and
with your permission we will get them over
as soon as possible.  I shall have the pleasure
of writing to you to-morrow.  To whom&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Phipps," she intimated.
</p>

<p>
"And mine is 'Warrener.'  Stay, I have a
card.  But, by the way, when did you propose
to let me come in, Miss Phipps?"
</p>

<p>
"Would next month suit you?" she asked.
"Perhaps you would prefer it to be early in the
month?"
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't disorder your arrangements for
the world, yet I own that 'early' has a musical
ring.  It would be agreeable to arrive before the
colder weather."
</p>

<p>
"There are places in England where winter's
cold blasts seem never to penetrate, and where
birds and flowers go on singing and blooming in
defiance of the calendar," she rejoined.
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Conrad.  "Still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And among such places," concluded the lady
firmly, "Sweetbay is pre-eminent....  But you
will let me give you another cup of tea?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
He could not persuade himself that the invitations
evoked enthusiasm, indeed two of them were
declined at the beginning.  Only Nina accepted at
once.  She wrote: "How on earth did you find
Sweetbay again&mdash;is it still on the map?  Yes,
I will come&mdash;and with 'no encumbrances'&mdash;but
I won't promise to be rural so long as all that.
If I were you, I would arrange with the Stores
for constant supplies.  Can you depend on the cook?"
</p>

<p>
Regina was obviously indignant at the exclusion
of her husband.  She replied that her cousin's
remembrance of their childhood was "quite
touching."  This was underlined.  "But though I fully
understand that Toto's presence would spoil your
romantic plan, I cannot pretend to forget that I
am now a wife, Conrad."  Conrad was perturbed.
He drove to Regent's Park and showed the letter
to Nina, and she said that her sister couldn't
forget she was a wife, because she had married a
remote relation of Lord Polpero's.
</p>

<p>
"They have stayed at the 'Abbey,' my dear;
at least she tells me they have as often as she
condescends to dine with us&mdash;Regent's Park is
'so far away' from their poky little place in
Mayfair!  She can just call it 'Mayfair' without
getting a remonstrance from the postal authorities.
An 'Abbey' has been too much for her.  Of
course Polpero is a pauper, and the Abbey's a
wreck, but I believe she slept with the family-tree
over her bed.  It's about the only tree of Polpero's
that the woodman has spared, but 'Gina
feels Norman."
</p>

<p>
Conrad was still perturbed.  He hastened to
appease Regina, and moderating his desires,
implored "Toto" to spare her to him just for a
week or two.  "Toto" said promptly that to
spend a couple of months at Sweetbay was exactly
what she needed for her cough.  So she was won,
and there remained only Ted to conquer.
</p>

<p>
As a young professional man with nothing to
do, Ted had naturally been slow to answer the
letter.  Young professional men make a point of
delaying a long time before they answer letters&mdash;it
shows how busy they are.  After they have
plenty of work on hand they answer more quickly.
When he wrote, he declared that the notion of
renewing their boyish memories in such tranquil
quarters appealed to him more forcibly than he
could say, but he was "so terribly hard pressed
that he feared he would get no change until he
ran over to Monte Carlo at the end of the
term."  He was at the Bar, waiting for briefs.
</p>

<p>
Conrad called at his chambers, and bore him
off to dinner.  Ted was fortunately independent
of his profession, and his immutable purpose was
to convince people that it was wearing him to
death.  In the restaurant he bent over his melon
a brow corrugated by the cares of imaginary suits;
he frowned at his soup through a monacle as
if he were perpending an "Opinion."  But it was
a dinner of supreme excellence, and then they
adjourned to the club.  If it had not been Ted's
club too, and socially undistinguished, Conrad
might have aspired to greater favours now.  Invite
a man to a club for which he is ineligible himself,
and he will remember you with kindliness no less
often than he drawls, "A fellow was telling me
in Brooks's the other day&mdash;"  Before they parted,
Ted had consented quite cheerfully&mdash;for the later
Ted&mdash;and all was well.
</p>

<p>
So the evening came when Conrad sat in
Mowbray Lodge looking forward to the morrow
and the arrival of the train due at twelve fifteen.
And he looked forward with more eagerness
because the evening&mdash;strange to say&mdash;was rather
melancholy, and the knowledge that he was going
to bed in the room where he had slept as a boy
induced a mood totally different from the mood
he had expected of it.  He did not feel a boy
as he sat in the silent house, by a bad light,
listening to the rain patter on the shrubs.  On the
contrary he felt increasingly old and increasingly
mournful while the long evening wore away.  The
dreary lamps depressed him, and the sad tick of
the clock, and the ceaseless dripping of the rain
sent him to the whisky-bottle.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast next day he bought lamps&mdash;several
of them&mdash;with duplex burners.  The
roads were a little sloppy, but the sky was blue.
He was gratified to reflect that his cousins were
doubtless blinking in a black fog; the permanent
pleasure of wintering in the country is the thought
of how unhappy our friends must be in town.  In
the forlornest watering-places of the south coast
you may notice, on a fine November morning,
people folding newspapers briskly, and looking
heavenward with a twinkle in their eyes.  They
are all returning thanks for the sufferings of their
friends in London.
</p>

<p>
The train due at twelve fifteen wound into view
at twelve thirty-five.
</p>

<p>
They were there!  Nina, alert, a smile on her
thin, shrewd face; Regina, with an air of having
travelled under protest; Ted, bowed beneath the
weight of the Law Courts.
</p>

<p>
"So you've come!"
</p>

<p>
"At last!  What a loathsome line!"
</p>

<p>
"Who's looking after the luggage?  Is there
a cab to be had?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course.  Do you suppose it's a village?"
</p>

<p>
"How hot it is!  You must be smothered in
those furs, dear?"  This to Nina from 'Gina.
'Gina was always expensively clothed, and badly
dressed, but she couldn't vie with the Regent's
Park sables.  "You must be half dead," she
insisted compassionately; "it's as warm as the
Riviera."
</p>

<p>
"We boast of it in our advertisements," said
Conrad, "but it isn't.  How did you leave Toto
and the family?"
</p>

<p>
He heard that it was a fine day in town too,
and secretly resented the fact.  The party drove
away, another "fly" rumbling with the baggage
in their wake.
</p>

<p>
"The lane!" he exclaimed as he sprang out.
"And it's the same as ever."
</p>

<p>
"I don't remember it a bit," said all three,
gazing about them vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"The garden!" he displayed it in triumph.
</p>

<p>
"I fancied it was quite big," said Nina.
"Funny how wee children's eyes exaggerate, isn't
it?"  But she had not really been so wee as all
that.
</p>

<p>
"The hall, where Boultbee was always ragging
us because we didn't wipe our shoes!"  He had
thrown the door open before the maid could run
upstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Who was Boultbee?" asked Regina.  "What
a memory you have!"
</p>

<p>
They lunched; and they were blithe at luncheon;
they discussed a divorce case in smart circles.
Regina said hurriedly that there was "another side
to the story."  She knew no more about it than
she had read in the papers, but she now moved
on the confines of smart circles, and there are
people who can never accustom themselves to
advancement, pecuniary or social.
</p>

<p>
"Her husband is such a scamp," she explained,
"such a scamp.  I don't defend her, but there's
so much that never came out in court.  Dear Lady
Marminger, her mother, was always against the
match; she always felt it would be fatal.  I
recollect when we were staying at the Abbey
once&mdash;"  She was the most obnoxious variety of
snob: the middle-class woman who has married
into the fringe of society.  If she had written
novels, everybody in them who wasn't a duchess
would have been a duke.
</p>

<p>
"One of the cleverest things ever said in the
divorce court," Ted began judicially, "was when
Hollburn was cross-examining&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the scamp theory is worn out," struck
in Nina.  "When a woman has married a scamp,
her family feel provided with an excuse for
everything odious she does all the rest of her life."
</p>

<p>
"Was when Hollburn was cross-examining&mdash;"  He
was not to be put off.
</p>

<p>
They were Nina, and 'Gina, and Ted, and
Conrad welcomed them with both hands, but he
caught himself thinking that for any influence
the surroundings had upon the conversation he
might as well have invited them to Princes'.
</p>

<p>
He took Ted to see the summer-house when
luncheon was over&mdash;the summer-house in which
they used to have their conferences when they
were such chums&mdash;and Ted was a disappointment.
The summer-house had withstood the
years, but the chum had gone.  He was affecting
interest, and it hurt&mdash;it hurt horribly, because
he was Ted and they were where they were.
He was led to Rose Villa, where Mary Page had
lived.  The sound of its name had made their
hearts ache once, and the same name was on the
same gate-post, visible to the same eyes.  He
passed it by, telling casual falsehoods about the
extent of the practice that he hadn't made, and
when the post was pointed out, he murmured:
"Oh, is it?  By Jove!"&mdash;maintained a perfunctory
pause for ten seconds, and broke it with,
"Well, as I was saying&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Afterwards they all sauntered to the esplanade,
and Conrad owned to himself that it was no
animated scene.  But the sun shone bright, and
when there is beautiful weather in Sweetbay it
almost compensates for the absence of everything
else there.
</p>

<p>
"Like spring," he observed; "isn't it?  Probably
there's a fog in town by now, or it's beginning
to snow.  We're all well out of it."
</p>

<p>
"Y-e-s," replied Nina.  "You don't find it a
little depressing seeing so many people in
bath-chairs, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"'So many people?'"  Regina was derisive.
"I've only seen seven human beings since we
arrived."
</p>

<p>
"Still the seven were all in bath-chairs," said
Nina.
</p>

<p>
"One expects to meet people in bath-chairs
at the seaside," Conrad pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"But not sick people," she said, "here they are
conscientious.  It's a pretty little band-stand; what
time does the band play?"
</p>

<p>
"It'll begin in June, I think," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"June?" cried Regina.
</p>

<p>
"It's not the season," he pointed out.  "Of
course it's quiet just now."
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish to cavil," said Ted, with a
forbearing smile, "but when you tell us it is not
the season, I am struck by a slight discrepancy
in your statements.  A few minutes ago you told
us it was a winter place."
</p>

<p>
"Well, so it is, but it's first of all an English
place.  You mustn't ask for bands to discourse in
band-stands all the year round, my dear fellow&mdash;such
things don't happen....  A 'town band'
enlivens the streets once a week, I believe; I'm not
an authority yet&mdash;I only came down yesterday
morning, and I've been setting my house in order.
There's a theatre," he added hopefully; "we
might drop in to-night, if you like.  I can't say
what is going on there, but we'll ascertain."
</p>

<p>
They spied a framed play-bill in a confectioner's
window on the way back, and stopped to examine
it.  Though the piece was familiar to them, and
the names of the company were strange, they
crowded before the play-bill cheerfully until they
discovered that it bore an ancient date.  The
theatre, they learnt, was now closed, excepting
for an orchestral concert every Thursday evening.
This was Saturday.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have a jolly evening at home," said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't a billiard table, I suppose?"
inquired Regina; "I'm an awful swell with the
cue.  I make them play every night at the Abbey
when we're there.  Polpero chaffs me about it
immensely; he's one of the old school&mdash;sweet,
but of the old school.  It's such fun&mdash;I chaff
him back.  Toto <i>roars</i>."
</p>

<p>
The inventory had not included a billiard table,
but he remembered after dinner that he had seen
a Pier "Pavilion" advertised, and his guests
seemed encouraged when he mentioned it.  Regina
said it was fun to be "bohemian" sometimes.
</p>

<p>
The place looked less animated still when they
sped forth to be "bohemian."  Its aspect was no
longer sedate, it was bereaved.  The vacant High
Street mourned behind its shutters.  At the
Quadrant a forsaken policeman kept a doleful eye on
space.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody must be on the pier," said Conrad.
"As soon as we turn the corner we shall see the
lights."
</p>

<p>
Their feet sprung echoes in the stricken town
as they pressed forward; and through the gloom
that veiled a moaning sea, the pier became
distinguishable.  But no light was on it save the light
of a misty moon, no gas-jet glimmered among the
globes on either side.  The pay-box was black
and tenantless; the gates were locked.  Against
them leant a lonely board, announcing a "Refined
Entertainment" for the twenty-second evening of
the previous month.  The desolation of the scene
was tragic.
</p>

<p>
Their return was made in silence, and the first
thing happened that recalled the days of their
childhood here: they all went to bed early.
</p>

<p>
Nina wanted to know if she could be given
another room the next morning.  She remarked
that the slowest railways always made the most
fuss, and that a train had been rehearsing outside
her window half the night.  "It rattled and
snorted, and clashed and clanked till three
o'clock."  She acknowledged Conrad's regrets
and assurances with a plaintive sigh, and shook
her head feebly at her coffee cup.
</p>

<p>
It was raining.  That it can rain in Sweetbay
for a fortnight on end with no longer intervals
than the entr'actes at a fashionable theatre is not
distinctive; the idiocrasy of Sweetbay is that it
recommences raining twenty times a day as if the
deluge had bee, hoarded for a year&mdash;it rains as
if the heavens had fallen out.  Nina and 'Gina,
who had ventured into the lane "between the
showers," were drenched before they could gain
shelter, and they were taciturn when they had
changed their clothes.
</p>

<p>
The rain was still pelting when Ted went up
to town on Monday, and a vicious wind lashed
"sunny Sweetbay" when he came back.  On Tuesday
the ardour of the flood abated, but "the
fairest spot in England" was sodden under a
persevering drizzle, and a letter by the evening post
made Regina nervous about the health of her baby.
"Toto seemed a good deal worried," she said,
"and she thought under the circumstances she
ought to be at home."  She departed on
Wednesday in a cataract.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think she's good-looking?" asked Nina.
</p>

<p>
"She is not good-looking," said Conrad reflectively,
"but she's so convinced that she is that
she almost persuades you in moments."
</p>

<p>
"That's it," Nina assented; "she attitudinises
as if she were a beauty.  When they're shown
photographs of her with her face bent, men are
quite eager to know her.  Of course the baby's
bosh."
</p>

<p>
"I'll confess that I'm not anxious about the
baby myself, I'm afraid she found it rather slow
here.  I got <i>Punch</i> for her at the station, and a
servant went round before breakfast to order a
foot-warmer&mdash;it's necessary to give notice when
you'll want a foot-warmer&mdash;but it was weak
reparation.  You were all very good to come."
</p>

<p>
"If there were anything to read in the house,
I wouldn't mind so much," she said, "I mean I
wouldn't mind the weather.  If it ever leaves off,
we might go and try to find 'a select library in
connection with Mudie's.'"
</p>

<p>
"There are heaps of books in the house&mdash;I
can lend you all the poets."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather have something to read," she
said, "thanks.  Do you think if we found one, it
would be open oftener than once a week?"
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't misjudge the town by the
theatre," he expostulated; "that the theatre only
opens once a week is due to a combination of
circumstances that I don't know anything about,
but I am sanguine of the shops opening every
day."
</p>

<p>
"How long are you saddled with the place
for?"  Her tone was sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sorry I took it," he answered.  "Of
course everything is more or less a disappointment
except the unattainable.  When Columbus reached
the new world at last, the aborigines said, 'Well,
what do you think of Amurrica?'  He said, 'I
thought it would be bigger.'  A bird in the hand
is not worth two in the bush; on the contrary, a
lark in the sky is worth two in the pudding.  If
you ever scratched those pretty hands of yours
getting a glow-worm out of a hedge, you know
that, when you have brought it home, you wondered
why you had given yourself so much inconvenience
to acquire the little impostor.  Possession
strains&mdash;it depresseth her that gives, and him that
takes.  While it was in the hedge, the glow-worm
shone no less divine than the poet's star."
</p>

<p>
"Where was that?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"In a fable.  Did you think I meant a star of
the music-halls?  They weren't the fashion in
poetry yet.  He was a glorious poet enchanted by
a star of the heavens.  He stretched his arms to
it, he sang to it nightly.  And for his sake the
star 'stooped earthward, and became a woman.'  And
then the day came when the woman asked
her lover which was best&mdash;'The Star's beam,
or the Woman's breast':&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'I miss from heaven,' the man replied,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A light that drew my spirit to it.'<br />
  And to the man the woman sigh'd,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I miss from earth a poet.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"M-m, that's rather sensible," admitted Nina,
"I like that&mdash;I suppose it can't be really great
poetry.  What get on my nerves so in the poetry
of the Really Great are those irritating words that
I knew were coming, like 'porphyry' and
'empyrean,' and 'bower' and 'nymph;' and then
there are the titles&mdash;they always sound so dull
because I never know what they mean.  Well, go
on talking to me."
</p>

<p>
About eleven o'clock the downpour ceased, and
presently a timid sunbeam played upon a puddle.
They went out to look for a library at noon.
There was no need for umbrellas.
</p>

<p>
The librarian was a listless young woman of
"superior manners."  When not occupied among
the literature, she assisted in the fancy
department.  While Nina was lingering at the shelves,
three other readers went to the counter, and the
first lady said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Good morning.  I want a ... book.
Something&mdash;er&mdash;rather exciting."
</p>

<p>
The young woman threw an omniscient glance
at the collection, and plucked.  The lady read
the title aloud:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is this rather exciting?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, madam, that is very exciting."
</p>

<p>
"Oh."  She ruffled the pages irresolutely.
"It's not very long," she murmured; "haven't
you anything longer?"
</p>

<p>
The young woman plucked.
</p>

<p>
"Is this rather exciting?" asked the lady.
</p>

<p>
The librarian assured her that it was no less
exciting than the other novel.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the lady...  "'The Face in the
Drawer.'  Oh ... I'll take this one then.  You
know the address, don't you?  Good morning."
</p>

<p>
The requirement of the second lady was:
"Something pretty ... not too short ... to
last me through the week."  Conrad almost
expected to hear the librarian reply that they had
"A very durable line at three-three," but she
plucked again.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I like it?" inquired the lady trustfully.
</p>

<p>
The young woman, listless, but confident, told
her that she was "Certain to like that."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure?" said the lady.  "Oh, very
well then&mdash;I'll have it.  Good day."
</p>

<p>
The third subscriber was still more free from
the vice of favouritism.  She simply stated that
she wanted "A nice book to read."  The librarian
handed a book to her, and she accepted it as
unquestioningly as if it had been stamps in a
post-office.  In not one of the three cases had any
author's name been mentioned.  There are popular
writers, there is a public besieging the libraries
for their work, but the literary choice of the
Nation is bulk for its twopence and the tale
admired by the young woman at the desk.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you haven't been bored?" said Nina
at last, holding out half-a-dozen volumes to be
carried for her.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the faintest degree," cried Conrad.
</p>

<p>
But he was exceedingly bored on the morrow
when Ted returned to dinner with elaborate excuses
for bringing his visit to a sudden close.  Yes,
the host was bored then; he knew so well while
he responded: "What a nuisance!" and "Of
course it can't be helped," that Ted was not in
the least needed in town, only dull in Sweetbay.
They were all to have gone together to the
"Orchestral Concert," and when the barrister alleged
that he felt "too worn out," Conrad was not
pressing.  Nina went with him alone, and they
walked some way before they spoke.  She understood
that he was hurt; dimly she understood that
he had shown a stronger affection on his side than
they had shown on theirs.
</p>

<p>
"So the experiment is a failure, Con?" she said.
</p>

<p>
He sighed.  "I'm afraid there's no other word
for it.  It was rather idiotic of me&mdash;I might
have known you'd all be hipped."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think it's that," she declared;
"as a professional man Ted isn't free."  She was
ever ready to disparage Regina, but she had a
soft spot in her shrewdness for Ted.  "Of
course," she added after a moment, "his going
means that I shall have to go too; I can't stay
with you by myself, ridiculous as these things are."
</p>

<p>
"No, I thought of that," he said.  "I'm sorry.
I'm sorry <i>you're</i> going, Nina.  It's no use trying
to persuade him, I suppose?  If you told him you
didn't want to go&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Every woman is to be touched by oral sentiment,
excepting the sentiment of her lover whom
she does not love.  That irritates her to brutality.
Nina wavered:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I might," she owned.  "Perhaps he could
arrange."
</p>

<p>
"It would be very nice of you," he said; "and
really when you get used to Sweetbay, you'll
find it has a&mdash;a certain charm.  Hallo!  What's
the matter here?  Are we too soon?"
</p>

<p>
They were opposite the theatre, but the building
was dark.  His heart sank; he felt that the stars
in their courses were fighting against him.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't open," said Nina superfluously.
</p>

<p>
"We must have come too soon," he urged.
"Let's cross over, and see what time it begins."
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two they peered at the glum
frontage, puzzled, and then they descried&mdash;affixed
by its flap to a large door&mdash;a small envelope.
It was an official announcement.  On the
envelope was written, "No concert this evening."
</p>

<p>
They turned away, and moved in reverie
towards the sea, which shimmered within sight.
</p>

<p>
On the long lamp-blurred stretch of asphalt no
one moved.  A mile of downcast lodging-houses,
veiled in gloom, kept hopeless watch over a blank
Parade; in their dim fan-lights the legend of
"Apartments" looked the emblem of despair.  To
the right the black pier slumbered silently; to the
left a lugubrious hotel, unpeopled and unlit,
imparted to the view the last symbol of disaster.  On
a sudden, spasmodically&mdash;in the wide-spread
desolation&mdash;the town band burst into the overture
to "Zampa."  It was the jocularity of hysteria
at a funeral.  Nina gave a gulp, and clutched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Conrad," she quavered, "let me go home
to-morrow, or I shall cry!"
</p>

<p>
He did not plead with her; he recognised that
there was some justice in her plaint.  He
promised that she should go by an early train, and
his kindness cheered her.
</p>

<p>
She came down to breakfast with her hat on.
</p>

<p>
She, too, had <i>Punch</i> and a foot-warmer, and
again he doubted if they were adequate to
exculpate him.
</p>

<p>
"Try to bear no malice," he begged on the
platform.
</p>

<p>
"You'll dine with us as soon as you come back,
won't you?" she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, old chap," exclaimed Ted.  He
had risen quite vivacious.  "Mind you look me up
when you're in town; let me know well ahead,
and I'll manage a spare evening."
</p>

<p>
"I expect I've left a lot of things behind," said
Nina brightly, bending to the window; "you
might tell the servants to send them on."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll tell them.  Are you sure you don't
want any more papers?"
</p>

<p>
"We're a long time starting, aren't we?" said
Ted.
</p>

<p>
"You're just off," Conrad answered.
</p>

<p>
It was less than a week since he had loitered on
the other side, impatient for their arrival.  He
forced a smile, and stood bareheaded, and turned
from the station with a sigh.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Oh near ones, dear ones! you in whose right hands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own rests calm; whose faithful hearts all day<br />
  Wide open wait till back from distant lands<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought, the tired traveller, wends his homeward way!<br />
  Helpmates and hearthmates, gladdeners of gone years'&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Where are you?</i>" said Conrad.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
He felt very lonely.  Something of the Christmas
spirit descended on him&mdash;the true, the
unacknowledged Christmas spirit, in which, after we
have directed the last stack of cards, and hurried
out aglow with the last parcel, we sit before the
bare mantel-piece, discovering that most of our
acquaintances have become too advanced to
observe the season.  We are quite sure it is
"advancement," though it looks a little like stinginess.
He wondered, as he entered the lane, whether the
other child he was remembering would have
proved a disappointment too; wondered if the
ache in his heart would be intelligible to her, or if
he would appear to her absurd.  It interested him
to wonder.  Conjecturing the disposition of the
strange woman whose whereabouts he did not
know, he endued her with many attributes that he
admired, and she moved before his mental vision
gradually as a fair and slightly pathetic figure,
prepared to be his confidante.  He fancied she
was unhappy with her husband.  At least the
sadness of life had touched her enough to tinge her
sentiment with cynicism, and she had flashes of wit
on rainy days.
</p>

<p>
It surprised him that he had made no attempt
to trace her; his curiosity was awake.  Many
things were more unlikely than that she was living
in the town.  As he passed Rose Villa he was in
two minds about ringing the bell and trying to
gather information from the present occupants.
He would probably have obeyed the impulse, but
while he hesitated the householder came out&mdash;a
middle-aged little man, with a sanguine
complexion, and gaiters.
</p>

<p>
Conrad accosted him.  "Excuse me," he began.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman saluted with his crop.  "'Morning,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"I was looking at your bell with the idea of
troubling you with an inquiry about a 'missing
friend.'  May I ask if you happen to know the
address of your predecessor here&mdash;Dr. Page?"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" said the little man briskly.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Page."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Don't know the name.  Took the place
of people called&mdash;er&mdash;Greames....  Agents
might tell you&mdash;Chipper and Stokes in the High
Street.  Page?  Doctor?  N-no."  He shook his
head.  "Sorry."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all.  Neighbours, I think, sir?  For long?"
</p>

<p>
"No; it's a very temporary pleasure of mine,"
said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"Congratulate you," said the little man.  "If
your friend was a doctor, probably knew better
than to stop.  Much misled myself.  Recommended
here for my health.  Most in-<i>ju</i>-rious!
Damp, sir, Sweetbay is damp.  They call it a
'humid atmosphere'; 'humid atmosphere' be
damned, sir!  Take your clothes off the peg in the
morning and wring 'em out.  That's not a humid
atmosphere&mdash;it's a death-trap."
</p>

<p>
"You astonish me," said Conrad.  "I understood
the climate was so salubrious that the
inhabitants would all live to be a hundred if they
didn't die of the dulness young."  He lifted his
hat.  "I am obliged."
</p>

<p>
"Pleasure," said the neighbour.  "Er&mdash;hope
we shall&mdash;er, er&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I hope so too," smiled Conrad.  "Er&mdash;no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"'Morning," said the gentleman, saluting with
his crop.
</p>

<p>
It was discomfiting to find the occupant of
Mary's former home so completely ignorant of
Mary.  Such ignorance, there, on the very threshold,
in view of the sun shutters that had framed
her face, seemed rather callous of him.  As
Conrad watched him swagger up the lane, he resented
the usurper's privilege to stretch his gaitered legs
on the hearth to whose history he was so utterly
indifferent.
</p>

<p>
Somehow the drawing-room looked emptier still
to Conrad for the colloquy, when he went indoors.
In the violent disassociation of the next house
from Mary Page, this one seemed suddenly
foreign to him; suddenly he felt that he had
committed a fatuous and a mournful act in taking it.
Sweetbay had meant to him four persons, and of
these, three had fled, and the fourth was lost.
Why should he stay here?  He thought vaguely
of a little dinner at "Odd-and-even's," and a stall
at the Alhambra.  He nearly stretched his arm for
the time-table&mdash;and all the while the melancholy
that oppressed him urged him to remain and find
Mary.  His mind demanded her more insistently
than before.  It was no longer a whim: it was a
strenuous desire.  "After all, it would be a crazy
thing, to go to London for pleasure!" he mused.
"I'll hear what the agents have to say."
</p>

<p>
He strolled to their office after luncheon, and
a small boy told him that Mr. Stokes was in.  For
once Conrad chafed at the local languor.  The
torpid tradesmen, unconcerned whether he bought
or not, had amused him, but the heavy young
man who gazed at him with vacant eyes was irritating.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Page?" echoed the young man dully;
"Rose Villa?  There was a Dr. Page in
Esselfield, wasn't there?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Conrad.  "Perhaps you
can tell me.  Where is Esselfield?"
</p>

<p>
"That's along the Esselfield Road," said
Mr. Stokes with deliberation.  "What do you want to
know for?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm trying to learn the address of a friend
who has moved," Conrad explained, labouredly
polite.
</p>

<p>
"Oh y-e-s."  He paused so long that it seemed
doubtful if he would speak again.  "There was a
Dr. Page in Esselfield; I can't say if he's there
still."
</p>

<p>
"The gentleman I mean was&mdash;well, he must
be an elderly man," said Conrad.  He could not
remember in the least how Dr. Page had looked;
he wished he knew his Christian name.  "An
elderly man.  He had a family.  They used to be
at Rose Villa, next door to Mowbray Lodge.  I'm
talking of years ago&mdash;a good many years ago....
Perhaps your partner might be able to assist me?"
</p>

<p>
"Major Bompas lives at Rose Villa now," said
Mr. Stokes.  His tone was a little firmer, the tone
of one who says a helpful thing.
</p>

<p>
"And he took it of people called 'Greames';
I know all that.  Dr. Page had the house before
the Greames."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," murmured Mr. Stokes, "did he?  Y-e-s....
No, I couldn't say, I'm sure.  Mr. Greames
lived there before Major Bompas.  Mr. Greames
was there a long while back."
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Page lived there in&mdash;let me think,
where are we now?  It must have been in eighteen
seventy-seven."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Gawd!" said the young man faintly.  For
the first time an expression humanised his
countenance, an expression of dismay tempered with
entertainment.  It made Conrad feel prehistoric.
"Eighteen sev-enty-sev-en?  I'm sure I couldn't
tell you who lived there then."  A snigger escaped
him.  "There was a Dr. Page at Esselfield," he
repeated; "he may have been at Rose Villa first."
</p>

<p>
"Is there any place in the town," asked Conrad,
with frank disgust, "where it's possible to
see an old directory?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't think," averred the heavy young
man, "that a directory was published in Sweetbay
in 'sev-enty-sev-en."  There was nearly a twinkle
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Conrad.  "Good afternoon."
</p>

<p>
He went forth to seek the Esselfield Road
incensed as well as disappointed now.  'Seventy-seven?
Who was this blank-faced dolt to jeer at
'seventy-seven?  Sweetbay had been an infinitely
more attractive place in 'seventy-seven than it was
to-day.  The High Street bored him as he walked.
Once it had been stimulating, replete with
interest, and now it was unworthy his attention.  He
looked at it as a young girl looks at a married
man.  There was a fresh-coloured woman dandling
her baby behind the glass door of a baker's
shop as he passed, and he recognised with a frown
that she had not been born in 'seventy-seven.  It
was a small matter, but it depressed him more.
</p>

<p>
The sepulchral window of a monumental mason
caught his glance.  Overhead was the inscription,
"Established 1852."  He wavered in his course
and entered.  The interior was like a premature
graveyard, ranged with marble tombstones waiting
for allotment, and brittle wreaths lamenting
the dissolution of "Beloved" relatives who were
still alive.  There seemed to him something
appropriate in pursuing his investigations among the
tombstones.  But though the business had been
established in 1852, the mason himself proved to
be very recent.  When he realised that his
interlocutor was not there to give an order, the
sympathetic droop of his bearing evaporated, and he
straightened into a careless soul to whom the
mention of 'seventy-seven was almost as disconcerting
as it had been to Mr. Stokes.
</p>

<p>
The Esselfield Road was thick with mud after
the heavy rains.  His long tramp&mdash;for he had
learnt that it was necessary to walk&mdash;had no
enlivening effect on Conrad's mood, nor was the
village cheering when he reached it.  A few houses
were scattered beside a common; some geese
waddled around a pond.  Beyond an inn, a
labourer in his cups shouted a refrain of the London
music-halls.
</p>

<p>
Conrad went into the "bar-parlour" and asked
for beer.  In the sensitiveness to his years which
was being so rapidly developed in him he observed
with satisfaction that the untidy proprietress was
middle-aged.  "Yes, there had been a Dr. Page,".
she told him.  "Not what you might call a
regular doctor&mdash;he didn't do nothing.  She believed
he had moved into Sweetbay, so as to be near the sea."
</p>

<p>
"I understood that he moved here from Sweetbay.
An elderly man.  He had a family," said
Conrad with fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"There was two young gals," she agreed.
"<i>They</i> was always about."
</p>

<p>
"'About'?" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Picking, and skating, and that.  I used to say
they was never at 'ome."
</p>

<p>
"Oho?" said Conrad.  And added to himself,
"The younger children grown up.  Girls of
spirit!"&mdash;"When did they leave?" he continued.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it must be a long time," she answered.
She turned to a man who had the air of being her
husband.  "'Ow long is it since that Dr. Page was
'ere, pa?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Page," drawled the man wonderingly.
"Oh, it's a long time ago."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she repeated, "it's a long time ago."
</p>

<p>
"But, roughly, how long?" persisted Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"W-e-ll, it must be&mdash;eight years or more," she
said, visibly resenting an occasion to be definite.
</p>

<p>
In his soul he groaned; if eight years seemed
so remote, what would they think of twenty-five?
Again he was bowed beneath the sense of senility.
"You don't happen to know where he settled in
Sweetbay?" he proceeded.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, she had no idea at all;
neither of the pair had any idea, so he finished his
ale, and paid for some cigars, which there was of
course no need to smoke.
</p>

<p>
The lamps were winking through the dusk when
he drew in sight of Sweetbay.  At a stationer's
he bought a directory of the current year, and
studied it at the counter.  It contained a "Captain
Page," and "John Page, milkman."  He found
also "Miss Page, ladies' outfitter," and
"Mrs. Page, laundress," but there was no "Page" of
promise among the leaves.  He availed himself
of the opportunity to inquire again concerning
the likelihood of his discovering an ancient copy
of the work, but at his reference to 'seventy-seven
the stationer, too, fell agape.  It recurred to
Conrad that in connection with Mr. Boultbee the
post-office had been suggested.  Physically he was tired
by now, but mentally he was unflagging, and he
bent his steps to the general post-office forthwith.
The clerk who sold the stamps to him "couldn't
say"; she retired, however, to repeat his question
to the postmistress, and it was at this point that
the outlook brightened.  The postmistress was a
young and gracious woman in a pink blouse, and
she came forward with a confident smile to inform
him that Dr. Page was no longer a resident of
Sweetbay, but had removed to Redhill.  "Redhill?"  He
had not suspected that anyone ever
got out there.
</p>

<p>
"An elderly man.  He had a family," he reiterated
with exhaustion.  "Two young girls."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," she nodded, "that's the same.
Very pretty, tall young ladies?  <i>They</i> were always
in and out."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said Conrad.  Mary's sisters began
to beckon to him.  "Can you help me to
communicate with Dr. Page?"
</p>

<p>
"We have the address he left with us&mdash;the
one we used to forward letters to; I don't know
if he's there still."  She confessed the limitation
of her knowledge with regret.  "It's some years
since he went from Sweetbay."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would be so merciful as to give
me the one you have?  I am an old friend of
Dr. Page's family&mdash;very old&mdash;and till Providence
directed my steps to you I despaired of finding
them again."  He outlined the difficulties he had
encountered, but he had grown diffident of
mentioning 'seventy-seven.
</p>

<p>
The postmistress laughed quite mirthfully at his
recital, which, encouraged by her appreciation, he
falsified sufficiently to make amusing.  After
bidding the clerk turn to a book, she announced to
him that the address was "Home Rest, Peregrine
Place," and the assurances of his gratitude seemed
amply to repay her.
</p>

<p>
Conrad went to bed with much more exhilaration
than he had looked for.  The day, after all,
had seen something accomplished.  Within his
head, when he punched the pillow, the project of
running Dr. Page to earth on the morrow promised
agreeable developments.  At the onset the
interview would be a trifle embarrassing he
foresaw, inasmuch as the gentleman on whom he
intruded would certainly have no recollection of his
name; but the ice would break under a few suave
references to "My first visit to the neighbourhood
since I was a boy," and "My little playmates of
long ago"&mdash;he would put her in the plural, his
inquiries could be concentrated gradually.  If
Mary herself were living in Redhill he might
remain there.  He would intimate that he thought
of doing so&mdash;it would forefend the suspicion of
impetuosity.
</p>

<p>
The sun was shining when he woke.  The birds
chirruped among the fir trees, and there were
echoes of old-time music in his heart while he
brushed his hair&mdash;until he fought to draw up a
sailor's knot under one of those "double collars"
that have led to so much domestic unhappiness at
the breakfast-table.
</p>

<p>
He travelled by the South-Eastern and Chatham,
but he reached Redhill, and smelt the tannery
as he searched for an exit from the station.
The salient features of Redhill are the smell of
leather, the shrieks of trains, and the all-night
barking of mongrels.  He was directed to Station
Road, and told to "bear to the left."  The
townlet seemed to him to blend the most unpleasant
characteristics of Clapham Junction and Hanley
in the Potteries.  He started briskly.  The way
was long, and several times he paused to seek
further information.  Occasionally a carriage
passed, the occupants with protesting noses.  By
degrees all the villas and the pavement dropped
behind him; the smell of the tannery was fainter,
and the path on either side was bordered by a
hedge.  From the altitude of a butcher's cart a
boy in blue encouraged him with the assurance that
Peregrine Place was "straight on."  Presently the
way wound, and a terrace of small semi-detached
houses with little front gardens gladdened his view.
As he drew close he saw "Home Rest" painted
on the gate-post at the corner.  Outside, in the
sequestered road, a venerable tenant, with a velvet
skull-cap and silvery hair, was pottering around a
camera.  At Conrad's approach he lifted his head,
and regarded him with gentle curiosity.  The sight
of the blue eyes and placid face seemed suddenly
familiar to Conrad; he felt far-off memories
stirring in him as his gaze met the old man's features,
and, doffing his hat, he murmured, with the
deference that sat so well upon him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Page, I think?"
</p>

<p>
"Heh?" said the old gentleman, inclining the
other ear.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know me," said Conrad wistfully,
but in a louder tone.  "We haven't met since I
was a boy, Dr. Page&mdash;that's many years ago."
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman indicated Home Rest impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Next door," he snapped, "Dr. Page lives next door!"
</p>

<p>
Conrad retreated with hasty apologies, feeling
considerably foolish.  He would have preferred
to stroll awhile before repeating his exordium,
and only the consciousness of being watched by
the old gentleman who had misled him constrained
him to unlatch the gate.
</p>

<p>
A neat servant answered that Dr. Page was
not at home.  He was relieved.
</p>

<p>
"I'll call again," he said.  "When do you
expect him to come in?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's away, sir, he won't be back for two
or three days.  Would you like to see Mrs. Page,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
He had no remembrance of a Mrs. Page, but
there was the objection to travelling fruitlessly,
and the thought that a woman would be susceptible
to the prettiness of his visit.  He hesitated&mdash;he
answered that he would.  The girl conducted him
to a small, cheerless drawing-room, and returned
to say that Mrs. Page would be down in a few
minutes.  There were antimacassars everywhere,
and the cold white mantelpiece exhibited the
perpetual porcelain courtship which has never
advanced; the amorous male still smirked inanely,
and the simpering maiden seemed still to hope.
Conrad was much attracted by a large album that
reposed on an occasional table.  He sat tempted
to unclasp it, and had just risen and made a
tentative step in its direction when he heard the
doorknob move.
</p>

<p>
The lady who came in seemed to deprecate her
entrance; she was evidently timid, and she blinked.
He thought at first that she suffered from some
affection of the eyes, but when she spoke, he
opined that the blinking was due entirely to
nervousness.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener?" she said in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Page," he began, "I must crave your
pardon for intruding on you in this fashion.  It's
very audacious of me because, even when I tell you
who I am, I daren't suppose that you will recollect
me."
</p>

<p>
Her eyelids fluttered more, and she said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Wo&mdash;won't you sit down?"  She wore mittens,
and plucked at them.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."  Instinctively he lowered his
voice, as if he were speaking to an invalid.  "My
excuse is rather unusual&mdash;I hope it won't appear
to you preposterous.  When I was a boy, your
children and I used to be bosom friends, and I
found myself in Sweetbay the other day for the
first time since.  I needn't tell you that I went to
look at the house, and the desire to&mdash;to find them
all again was very strong....  I was fortunate
enough to learn that you had moved to Redhill,
so I decided to risk your ridicule, and throw myself
on your forbearance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not at all," she faltered.  "I&mdash;I'm sure
I&mdash;"  Her nervousness seemed increased, rather
than diminished, by his address.  There was an
awkward pause.
</p>

<p>
"I trust Dr. Page and&mdash;and my former comrades
are all well?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, yes they are all quite well."
</p>

<p>
He wished that Mary's were not the only name
among them he could recall; "All well!" he said,
forcing a hearty note, "All well!  It's strange to
me to think of them as grown-up.  Time&mdash;er&mdash;brings
many changes, madam?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," she concurred timorously; "as you
say!"  But she volunteered no news, and he began
to feel that they were getting on slowly; his
harassed gaze wandered to the china courtship.
</p>

<p>
"May I ask if they are still with you?" he
ventured.
</p>

<p>
"My eldest daughter is married," she replied.
"The others are ... I hope very soon.  I&mdash;er
don't quite understand when it was you knew
them?  While we were in Sweetbay, I think you
said?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered musingly, "when the
daughter who is married was a little girl,
Mrs. Page.  To think that she's a woman and a wife!
Why, Miss Mary and I were like brother and
sister then&mdash;how wonderful it would be to meet
her now!"
</p>

<p>
"My daughter's name is Ursula," she demurred.
She blinked fast.  There was another
pause.
</p>

<p>
"'Ur&mdash;Ursula?'" stammered Conrad, with
the precursory sinking of an awful fear.  "Miss
Mary <i>not</i> the eldest? ... But surely at Rose
Villa she was the eldest at home&mdash;during that
summer, at least?"
</p>

<p>
"I think there must be some mistake," she
quavered; "I have no daughter 'Mary.'  I think
there must be some mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!" gasped Conrad.  He was
covered with confusion.  "My dear madam, what
can I say to you?  I&mdash;I have been most shamefully
deceived.  I knew the family of a Dr. Page
in Sweetbay in 'seventy-seven.  I was assured&mdash;I
was officially misinformed&mdash;that they had
removed to Redhill.  This house was mentioned to
me as their residence.  I am abased, I can't
sufficiently express my regret.  Possibly&mdash;I'll say
'probably'&mdash;my informant was led astray by the
sameness of the surname and the profession, but
nothing can excuse an error that has caused you so
much annoyance.  Nothing!" he repeated implacably.
"I can only offer you my profoundest, my
most contrite apologies."
</p>

<p>
The lady was now blinking so rapidly that it
was dazzling to watch her.
</p>

<p>
"My husband never practised in Sweetbay," the
said.  "My husband's name is 'Napoleon Page.'  We
had never seen Sweetbay in 'seventy-seven.
Our house was not called 'Rose Villa.'  Oh dear
no!  I'm afraid there must be some mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Obviously," cried Conrad; "it overwhelms
me.  I shall severely reprimand the person
who&mdash;who is responsible.  Permit me to thank you
for the patience, the infinite courtesy with which
you have listened to my&mdash;my totally irrelevant
reminiscences.  I&mdash;  Pray don't trouble to ring,
madam!"
</p>

<p>
His cheeks were hot when he gained the step.
He walked towards the station swiftly, eager to
leave "Home Rest" and Redhill far behind.
Long after the train, for which he was obliged to
wait, had started, the incident continued to distress
him.  He smarted anew in the compartment.  He
was even denied the unction of feeling he had
made a satisfactory exit, and the certainty that
the lady would describe his later demeanour as
"flurried" annoyed him more than he could say
in the presence of his fellow-passengers.  To fall
into the mistake was natural, he argued, but he
wished ardently that he had extricated himself
from it with more grace, with more of the leisurely
elegance he could display if the situation
were to occur again.
</p>

<p>
Well, he had done with his search for Mary!
He said he abandoned it in disgust, and was still
firm on the point when he reached Mowbray
Lodge.  He began to reconsider packing his
portmanteaux.  For two days he made no further
inquiry of anyone, and lingered, as it were, under
protest.  Yet in England at least he might spend
December amid worse surroundings than Sweetbay
presented now; he owned that.  From the
chief thoroughfares the last speck of mud had
long since been removed; the pink sidewalks
shone as spotless as when he trod them in October.
The air was tender, there was an azure sky,
a sunlit sea curled innocently upon the beach.  Yes,
of a truth, he might fare worse.  If it were not
for the dulness, he could scarcely fare better.  On
the third afternoon, as he sauntered through the
High Street, it occurred to him that it could do
no harm to announce his failure to the mirthful
postmistress.  He did not pledge himself to
resume his efforts, but&mdash;&mdash;  It certainly was very
dull, and if he were more explicit she might be
able to give him another hint.
</p>

<p>
She recognised him at once, and advanced,
sparkling as before.
</p>

<p>
"Did you find your friends, sir?" she asked
as he saluted her.
</p>

<p>
"I did not," said Conrad, "but I intruded
on an inoffensive household who were perfect
strangers to me.  The Dr. Page whose address
you very kindly furnished was not my Dr. Page
at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear! how very awkward," she said.  "I
am so sorry."
</p>

<p>
"It was awkward, wasn't it?" he concurred.
"Of course I threw all the blame on you, so they
forgave me, but I'm now quite helpless.  My
friends seem to have vanished as utterly as if
Sweetbay had closed over their heads, and to
complete the difficulty this family of spurious Pages
arose since.  I foresee that as often as I make
another attempt I shall be directed to Redhill.
I didn't like to tell you before, because it makes
me sound so old, but the people I mean are the
Pages who lived here in 'seventy-seven.  I beg of
you not to jump.  Everybody jumps&mdash;that's why
I have grown so nervous of mentioning the date."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were full of amusement; she leant
her elbows on the counter.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't in the office then," she said reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," he returned.  "You must have
been in your cradle.  <i>I</i> was only a little boy.
They were companions of my cherub stage;
believe me, I was rosily young."
</p>

<p>
"There's a gentleman in the town who might
be able to tell you something," she suggested:
"Mr. Irquetson, the vicar of All Saints.  He has
been here thirty years, or more."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" exclaimed Conrad, and added,
"It's a shame to be beaten, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is," she agreed; "and he's a very nice
gentleman; he'll be glad to help you if he can."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think I'll go to see him; if he has
been here thirty years, he can hardly fail to
remember the Dr. Page I'm talking about."  He
glanced at the clock.  "Do you think he's likely
to be in now?"
</p>

<p>
"I should think the morning would be the best
time, sir," she answered; "but you might try&mdash;it
isn't far.  If you'll wait a second, I'll write
the address down for you."
</p>

<p>
"You are too good," said Conrad impressively.
His pulses quickened at the chance.  Instantly
the thought of quitting Sweetbay was forgotten.
Again he thanked her, and again she bowed
graciously over her pink blouse as he withdrew.
When he turned at the doors, she was bowing still.
</p>

<p>
They swung to behind him, and he wished he
had reported himself to her three days ago.  What
amiability!  He had never seen anything to compare
with it in a post-office.  As he strode towards
the vicar's, he was possessed by amazement.  The
experience had an air of the ideal, as everybody
will admit.  Probably the mirthful postmistress
was the only member of her calling ever known to
exhibit a pleasant countenance to the public,
excepting&mdash;  But the Exception merits a paragraph to
herself, and as she has nothing to do with the story,
you are recommended to skip to the next chapter.
</p>

<p>
Excepting a little lady who once brightened the
ancient post-office of Southampton Row.  The
"post-office," have I said?  Rather should I say
she brightened the district with that sunny smile
of hers, and the daily flower freshening her neat
little frock.  To watch her, it seemed she found
long hours "in the cage" the very poetry of
bread-winning.  Dull matrons from Russell Square, and
tired clerks from Guilford Street alike felt the
encouragement of her cheerfulness, and went on
their way refreshed.  One may well believe she
was the unwitting cause of many kindly actions in
West Central London, for a crowd was ever at
the counter, and the sourest soul of all on whom
she smiled must for a space have viewed the world
with friendlier eyes.  Often I used to wonder, as
I bought a postcard, and waited for the farthing
change, whether it was interest in her duties, or
the message of the daily flower that kept that light
of happiness in the girlish face.  When she
vanished, Southampton Row was grey.  They
repainted and replanned it; and built spruce hotels,
and pink "mansions," but nothing could make
good the loss.  It was whispered she had left to be
married.  All Bloomsbury must hope that he is
kind to her!

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
And after that little tribute, which has been owing
for more years than it exhilarates me to
count&mdash;and which has been paid with no expense to
anyone who followed my advice&mdash;let us overtake
Conrad on the doorstep, where he had just learnt
that the vicar was at home.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Athol Irquetson was a sombre-eyed
priest with a beautiful voice.  In his zeal, he had
studied how to use it&mdash;under an eminent actor;
in his discretion, he suppressed the fact&mdash;for he
knew his Sweetbay.  He had also a fine faculty for
gesture, which his parishioners found
"impressive"&mdash;and which they would have found
"theatrical" had they guessed that for years it had
been cultivated daily before a looking-glass.  Why
invalidate an instrument?  To admiring friends
he said his gestures "came to him."  They did,
by this time.  He waved Conrad's apologies aside,
and motioning towards a seat, sank slowly into a
study-chair himself.  Conrad ardently appreciated
the pose of his hand there, as&mdash;a pensive profile
supported by his finger-tips&mdash;the vicar asked, in
a voice to make converts: "And what can I do
for you?"
</p>

<p>
Yes, he remembered Dr. Page.  Dr. Page was
dead.  But soon it was the vicar's turn to be
appreciative, for the intruder's glance kept straying
to the Canaletto prints that graced the walls, and
it was a rare thing for Mr. Irquetson to have a
visitor to whom they spoke.  Those glances
warmed his heart, and a digression melted his
reserve.
</p>

<p>
"There are not many," he said; "but I think
my small room is the richer on that account."
</p>

<p>
"Surely," said Conrad.  "If a picture is worth
owning, it is worth a spacious setting.  A mere
millionaire may buy a gallery, but it takes a man
of taste to hang a sketch.  I have always thought
that a picture calls for two artists&mdash;one to
create it, and the other to prepare his wall for its
reception."
</p>

<p>
"But how little the second art is understood.
Of course the eye should be enabled to rest on a
picture reposefully.  The custom of massing pictures
in conflicting multitudes is barbarous.  It's
like the compression of flowers into bundles that
hide half their loveliness.  The Western mind is
slowly learning from the Japanese that a flower
ought to be displayed so that we may appreciate
its form.  I have hope that when they have taught
us how a flower should be put in water, they may
proceed to teach us how a picture should be hung."
</p>

<p>
Quite ten minutes passed in such amenities.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Dr. Page died long ago," said the deep
voice again; but the subject was resumed in a
manner almost intimate; "his wife was living
in&mdash;Malvern, I think.  There was&mdash;it was
common knowledge at the time&mdash;some domestic
unhappiness late in life; or perhaps it would be more
correct to say that it culminated late in life, for,
like so many mighty issues, I believe it originated
in a seeming trifle.  He was a man acutely
sensitive to noise, and his wife was decidedly a noisy
woman.  I remember his remarking once that if
she but touched a cup it had a collision with all the
china on the table, and that a newspaper in her
hands became an instrument of torture.  No doubt
he could have controlled his irritability, but by all
accounts his temper grew unbearable.  However,
the news of his death must have been a blow to
the lady, for he died suddenly soon after they had
separated.  Death is a wondrous peacemaker.
The gravest offence looks smaller in our eyes when
it is too late to condone it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," assented Conrad;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'And I think, in the lives of most women and men,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a moment when all would go smooth and even,<br />
  If only the dead could find out when<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back, and be forgiven.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"That is a beautiful thought," said the vicar,
"or, speaking more strictly, I should say it is an
ordinary thought beautified.  From one of Owen
Meredith's early poems, isn't it?  But do you
remember those lines of Coventry Patmore's to the
dead?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'It is not true that Love will do no wrong.<br />
  Poor Child!<br />
  And did you think, when you so cried and smiled,<br />
  How I, in lonely nights, should lie awake,<br />
  And of those words your full avengers make?<br />
  Poor Child, poor Child!<br />
  And now, unless it be<br />
  That sweet amends thrice told are come to thee,<br />
  O God, have Thou no mercy upon me!<br />
  Poor Child!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh," exclaimed Conrad, "exquisite!  I used
to read Coventry Patmore all day.  Do you know
'Departure'?&mdash;'With <i>huddled</i>, unintelligible
phrase!' ... Ah! surely his hope was not vain&mdash;the
Posterity he respected will respect him.
But&mdash;but," he bubbled, "I am so glad I came!
My dear sir, you enchant me; your recognition of
Owen Meredith alone would make the interview
memorable."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" returned Mr. Irquetson, with a whimsical
smile, "there was once a time when I read
much poetry&mdash;and wrote much verse; and I have
a good memory.  I remember"&mdash;his trained
gaze took in the name, which he had forgotten, on
the card&mdash;"I remember, Mr. Warrener, when
I used to pray to be a poet."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think prayers are ever answered?"
inquired Conrad.  "In my life I have sent up
many prayers, and always with the attempt to
persuade myself that some former prayer had been
fulfilled.  But I knew&mdash;I knew in my heart none
ever had been.  Things that I have wanted have
come to me, but&mdash;I say it with all reverence&mdash;at
the wrong time, as the means to buy unlimited
toffee comes to a man when he has outgrown his
taste for sweets."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Irquetson's fine hand wandered across his
brow.
</p>

<p>
"Once," he began conversationally, "I was
passing with a friend through Grosvenor Street.
It was when in the spring the tenant's fancy lightly
turns to coats of paint, and we came to a ladder
leaning against a house that was being redecorated.
In stepping to the outer side of the ladder,
my friend lifted his hat to it; you may know the
superstition?  He was a 'Varsity man, a man of
considerable attainments.  I said, 'Is it possible
that you believe in that nonsense?'  He said,
'N&mdash;no, I don't exactly believe in it, but I never
throw away a chance.'"  On a sudden his inflexion
changed, his utterance was solemn, stirring,
devout: "'I think, sir, that most people <i>pray</i> on
my friend's principle&mdash;they don't believe in it,
but they never throw away a chance.'"
</p>

<p>
He had said it before; the whole thing was too
assured, too finished, for an impromptu, but the
effect of that modulation was superb.  All the
artist in Conrad responded to it.
</p>

<p>
"And when they are sincere?" he questioned,
after a pause; "for they are sometimes.  Your
walls remind me how passionately I prayed to be
a painter.  And your own prayers, I take it, came
from the soul when you craved to be a poet."
</p>

<p>
"But should I have been more useful as a poet?
It wouldn't have contented me to write&mdash;let us
say&mdash;'The Better Land,' and more minds are to
be influenced by simple sermons than by great
poetry.  You think, perhaps, that as a painter you
would have been happier.  But perhaps you
wouldn't.  We are often like little children
petitioning their parents for the dangerous.  I will
not suggest that a merciful God chastises us to
demonstrate our error, but many an observant
man must have noticed the truth that what we
have desired most strenuously often proves an
affliction to us, while the only sunshine in our lives
is shed by the thing which we prayed might never
come to pass."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Conrad, thoughtfully, "I have
seen more than one example of that.  But if we
are mere blunderers beseeching in the dark&mdash;if
we are like children importuning their parents
without discernment, as you say&mdash;isn't the act
of prayer futile?  Isn't it even presumptuous?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Irquetson raised his head, his eyes looked
upward; "No&mdash;pray!" he said, and the melody
of his tone gave glory to a commonplace.
"Pray," he repeated, and Conrad wanted to kneel
to him then, there, on the study floor.  "One day
perhaps you will afford me an opportunity to make
my thoughts on prayer quite clear to you.  Pray&mdash;but
with fervour, and with sense.  With humility!
Sir, I cannot reconcile my faith in an omniscient
Creator with the idea that it is necessary
to advise Him we need rain in Rutland ... But
I'm withholding the little information that I am
able to give you.  I was about to say that
Mrs. Page, so far as I know, lives still in
Malvern&mdash;or perhaps it was Matlock; and the eldest
girl&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mary?" interposed Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, 'Mary.'  Mary married some time
before her father's death, and is settled in London,
I think.  My wife would know her whereabouts
better than I, she is friendly with a resident who
has some fitful correspondence with Mrs. Bailey."
</p>

<p>
"'Mrs. Bailey' is the eldest girl's married
name?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it used to be," replied the clergyman,
with another of his smiles.  "But I was wrong&mdash;I
should have said 'Mrs. Barchester-Bailey.'  She
acquired the 'Barchester' after the ceremony;
I cannot supply its exegesis.  The result of six
months in the capital, I suppose, though it is not
everybody who can make such a great name in
London in six months."
</p>

<p>
"Much may be done in six months; his parents
gave Keats to the world in seven," said Conrad.
"I am infinitely grateful to you for your
kindness."  He rose.  "If Mrs. Irquetson should
mention Mrs. Barchester-Bailey's address to you, and
you would have the additional goodness to let me
know it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I will drop you a line to-night&mdash;or to-morrow
at the latest," declared the vicar; and he pencilled
the direction on the card.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," said Conrad.  "I shall always be
your debtor for more than the address, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," said the vicar, extending his hand;
and 'good-bye' as he pronounced it was a
benediction.
</p>

<p>
Conrad had been so much impressed&mdash;so uplifted
by the cleric's manner&mdash;that, instead of
swinging homeward in high feather at the end of
his difficulties, he proceeded slowly, in serious
meditation.  It was not until the following
afternoon when he learnt that Mrs. Barchester-Bailey's
residence was Beau Séjour, Hyperion Terrace,
Upper Tooting, that interest in his project
was again keen.  Then there was a little throb in
his pulses; a little tremor stole from the note;
he had annihilated the obstacles of five-and
twenty years&mdash;it excited him to realise that
he stood so close to her who had been Mary Page.
</p>

<p>
The "Barchester," however, disturbed him
somewhat.  A woman who reverenced apocryphal
hyphens promised less companionship than he had
pictured ... Perhaps the snobbishness was her
husband's.  Tooting?  He had a dim recollection
of driving through it once, on his way somewhere.
Was it to the Derby?
</p>

<p>
Well, he supposed the correct course would be
to write to her and hint at his return to town.  He
wondered whether the signature would waken
memories in her if she perpended it.  Unless it did,
the letter was likely to prove a failure&mdash;he could
not indite a very stimulating epistle to a married
woman of whom he knew nothing.  Yet to call on
her without writing&mdash;?  No, he must stand, or
fall, by the signature.  That would say everything,
if it said anything at all ... How stupid, in the
circumstances, "Dear Madam" sounded!
</p>

<p>
And what a stumbling-block it looked!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dear Madam"&mdash;he wrote&mdash;"Though I
cannot hope you will be able to recall my name, I
think you may remember Mowbray Lodge.  I have
regretted very much, during my visit, that
Mrs. Page is not my neighbour.  It would have given
me so much pleasure to call on her, and to meet
the family who were such very good comrades
of mine in the year when this house was a school,
kept by Mr. Boultbee, and a posse of children
came down for the summer holidays.  Perhaps
the names of my cousins, Nina and 'Gina, may be
more familiar to you than my own.  At least those
old-time friends of yours have shared my
disappointment.  It is only since they left that I have
had the good fortune to hear your address
mentioned.  Will you pardon a stranger writing to
express this vehement interest on the part of
people whom you have probably forgotten?  If
I debated the matter for long, my courage would
desert me, and I should leave my cousins to make
their own inquiries next week, when I go back to
town.  On the other hand, if you and your sisters
remember us, pray believe that none sends kinder
regards to you all than&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Yours truly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CONRAD WARRENER."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Come, I don't think anybody can take exception
to that," mused Conrad.  And he sent it to
the post, with a line of thanks to Mr. Irquetson.
</p>

<p>
On the next evening but one he began to doubt
if she meant to reply.  It seemed to him the sort
of thing a woman would acknowledge immediately
if she didn't mean to ignore it altogether.
Yet why should she ignore it?  Silence would be
rather uncivil, wouldn't it&mdash;a humiliation needlessly
inflicted?  If she had reasons for wishing
to decline his acquaintance, it was quite possible
to prevent his advancing, and to frame an urbane
answer at the same time.  Had he said too much
about Nina and 'Gina, appeared too much in the
light of an amanuensis?  Surely she had the wit
to understand?
</p>

<p>
Four or five days passed before he tore open
an envelope stamped with the initials "M.B.B."  The
enclosure began "Dear Sir," and his brows
contracted.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dear Sir"&mdash;he read&mdash;"I was very surprised
to receive your letter.  What a long time
ago, is it not?  It is very nice of you all to
remember us after so long.  I left Sweetbay at the time
of my marriage, and have been living in Tooting
some years now.  My mother has removed to
Matlock.  If you or your cousins are ever in the
neighbourhood I shall hope to have a chat over
old times.  Please give them my remembrances,
With kind regards&mdash;Yours truly,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MARY BARCHESTER-BAILEY."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There were only three wrong ways of beginning
a response&mdash;three blatant solecisms&mdash;and
she had chosen one of them when she wrote
"Dear Sir."  Conrad was disappointed.  The
"fair and slightly pathetic" figure of his dreams
grew fainter; his ideal confidante didn't make
these mistakes.  He put the missive in his pocket,
and drew dejectedly at his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall go," ran his thoughts, "but
I've made rather an ass of myself, taking such
trouble to find her!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
The man to whom he gave his ticket at the station
of Balham and Upper Tooting told him that he
could walk to Hyperion Terrace in about ten
minutes.  He perceived that he would reach the
house too early if he proceeded there at once, so
he strolled awhile in the opposite direction.  The
pavements were dry, and he was thankful, for he
had seen no cab when he came down the station
stairs, and he would have been chagrined to
present himself in muddy boots.
</p>

<p>
When he estimated that he would arrive at
Beau Séjour none too soon to be welcome, he
retraced his steps, and now anticipation warmed
his blood once more.  After all, she was the
woman who had been Mary Page&mdash;it was a
piece of his boyhood that awaited him.  Indeed
he was repentant that he had cavilled at minor
defects.  By dint of inquiries he found the way to
Hyperion Terrace.  It was new, and red, and all
that a man who could call a street "Hyperion
Terrace" would naturally create.
</p>

<p>
A very small servant, wearing a very pretentious
cap, showed him at once to the drawing-room,
where "The Soul's Awakening" met his
distressed view, on a pink and gold wall-paper.
He heard flying footsteps overhead, sounds of
discomposure; there are houses at which a visitor
always arrives too early.  His nerves were
tremulous while he sat alone.  But Mary's home would
have pleased him better if it had been no more
than a single room, with a decent etching over a
bed masquerading as a sideboard, and half-a-dozen
shilling classics on a shelf.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener?  How d' ye do?"
</p>

<p>
She advanced towards him with a wide smile,
a large and masculine woman wearing a vivid silk
blouse, and an air of having dressed herself in a
hurry.  She wore also&mdash;with a droll effort at
deception&mdash;a string of "pearls" which, if it had
been real, would have been worth more than the
street.  For an instant his heart seemed to drop
into his stomach; and in the next an overwhelming
compassion for her swept him.  He could
have shed tears for her, as he took her hand, and
remembered that she had once been a dainty child.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Barchester-Bailey&mdash;so good of you to
let me call."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm sure it was very kind of you to
come!" she said.  "Won't you sit down? ... How
very odd that you should have been
living in Mowbray Lodge, isn't it?  Quite a
coincidence."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "yes.  I wanted a place there,
and Mowbray Lodge happened to be to let for a
few months.  It was the first time I had been
to Sweetbay since that summer....  Your old
house looks just the same&mdash;the outside at least;
I've not been in it."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" she said.  "Yes&mdash;does it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes....  And the lane looks just the same
too, until you get to the field; and then&mdash;then
there isn't one.  But perhaps that had vanished
before you left?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there was no change when I was down
there last, but that's a long while ago!  Horrid
old place!  I'm very glad there's nothing to take
me there any more."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you like it?" he asked, pained.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it was so slow!  I wonder how I put up
with it as long as I did.  Didn't you find it slow?
I must have gaiety.  People tell me I'm a regular
gadabout, but&mdash;"  She laughed&mdash;"one's only
young once, Mr. Warrener; I believe in having a
good time while I can.  I say I shall have plenty
of time to be on the shelf by-and-by."
</p>

<p>
She was very, very plain.  It was while he was
thinking how plain she was, how ruthless the
years had been to her, that the sudden pity for
himself engulfed him&mdash;the pathetic consciousness
that she must be reflecting how hard the
years had been on <i>him</i>.
</p>

<p>
"It can't be difficult for you to have a good
time," he returned, labouredly light.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think it is," she declared; she
tossed her large head, and rolled colourless eyes
at him archly.  "People tell me I've quite woke
Tooting up since I've been here, and I must
say I've done my best.  I must <i>lead</i>.  I mean
to say if I'd been a man I should have liked
to be a great politician, or a great general, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"You could be nothing more potent than
Mrs. Barchester-Bailey."
</p>

<p>
"Oh now that's very sweet of you!" she said.
"But I mean to say I must <i>lead</i>.  I started the
Tooting 'Thursdays.'  You mustn't think I'm
just a frivolous little woman who cares for
nothing but pleasure&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm very interested in
literature too.  At the 'Thursdays' we have
literary discussions.  Next week the subject is Miss
Verbena's novels.  Now which do you think is
Miss Verbena's greatest novel?"
</p>

<p>
He could only assume that she never saw a
comic paper.  "I&mdash;I'm afraid I haven't read
any of them," he owned.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Oh, you surprise me.  Oh, but you must:
they're enormously clever.  Ettie Verbena is quite
my favourite novelist, excepting perhaps that
<i>dear</i> man who writes those immensely clever
books that never offend in any way.  So pure they
are, such a true religious spirit in them!  You
know, Mr. Warrener, I'm a curious mixture.
People tell me that I seem to enjoy myself just
as much talking to a very clever man as when
I'm romping through a barn-dance.  And it's
true you know; that is me.  But I suppose you're
more interested in stocks and shares, and things
like that, than in books?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I&mdash;I shouldn't describe myself as
widely-read," answered Conrad; "still books do
interest me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, then, you must come on one of my
At-Home days next time," she said graciously;
"one of the ladies you'll meet writes for
'Winsome Words,' and you'll meet several people
you'll like."
</p>

<p>
"I should be charmed," he said.
</p>

<p>
The servant bustled in, and carried a bamboo
table to the hearth.  As she threw the teacloth
over it, a cold wind blew through his hair.
</p>

<p>
"Do your cousins live in London?" inquired
Mrs. Barchester-Bailey, with the tail of a worried
eye on the maid's blunders.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "yes, they do.  But I haven't
seen them since I came back.  I'm not sure
whether they're in town."
</p>

<p>
"Are they married?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said again.  "Oh yes, they're
married&mdash;both of them."
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?" she asked; "anywhere
this way?"
</p>

<p>
"No; unfortunately they're a long way off.
That's the drawback to town, isn't it?  Everybody
lives at such a distance from everybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," she said; "one can get
about so quickly nowadays.  What part are they
in?"
</p>

<p>
"Nina lives in Regent's Park," he replied,
"where the mists are."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, really?  Regent's Park?"  She seemed
impressed.  "I was wondering whether she would
care to join our Thursday debates&mdash;we want to
get as many members as we can.  Two of the
ladies come over from Wandsworth, but from
Regent's Park it would be a drag certainly.  Shall
I put in sugar and milk?"
</p>

<p>
"Please."  He took the cup, and sat down
again&mdash;and knew that he had entered on that
grade of society where there are no more men
and women, and they all become "ladies" and
"gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"And the other one&mdash;'Gina?" she continued.
</p>

<p>
He felt very uncomfortable; he wouldn't say
"Mayfair."
</p>

<p>
"'Gina lives further west," he murmured.
"No, I won't have any cake, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Then your cousins are quite high up?" she
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"'High up?'"
</p>

<p>
"They're quite swells?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he shrugged his shoulders.  "No, I
don't think I should call them that.  Too swell for
me, rather, but then I'm half a Colonial, and the
other half a bohemian.  I haven't been Home
long&mdash;it's all strange to me; until I came out
here to-day I had no idea London could be so
picturesque.  How glorious your Common must
be in the summer!"
</p>

<p>
"So healthy!" she said promptly; "the air is
so fine.  We moved here from the West-end for
the children's sake."
</p>

<p>
"You have children?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she rolled her eyes again.  "Four,
Mr. Warrener.  My eldest boy is getting quite
big&mdash;people tell me they wouldn't believe he was mine
at all, but it makes me feel quite old sometimes,
to look at him.  I think it's cruel of children to
grow up, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
He stifled a sad assent.  "Sometimes they grow
up still more charming," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, now, that's very sweet of you!  Now
really that's very pretty.  But I mean to say I
think it's cruel to us when they shoot up so fast.
You're not married yourself yet, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I hate asking favours."
</p>

<p>
"What a modest way of putting it!  But you
should.  A good wife would be the making of you,
and give you something to think about.  Don't
you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure of it.  A man can have no greater
blessing than a good wife&mdash;excepting none," he
concluded mentally.  "Shall I be allowed to see
them before I go?"
</p>

<p>
"The children?  Would you like to?  Dudley
is out, but the others are just going to have tea
in the next room.  My husband isn't back from
the city yet, of course.  Oh, the city!  What a
hold it does get on you men.  As if it really
mattered whether you made an extra thousand pounds
one month or not!"  A trayful of crockery rattled,
and the footsteps of the little servant thudded
through the passage.
</p>

<p>
"You're quite right," said Conrad.  "What
does it matter, when one comes to think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not but what Herbert's the best of boys,"
she added.  "If it weren't that&mdash;&mdash;"  She
hesitated, she endeavoured to look confused.  "The
fact is, he's&mdash;he's jealous, he's a very jealous
man.  Not that he has any reason to be&mdash;not
exactly.  Of course I'm awfully fond of him;
he's a dear old silly!  But I mean to say I can't
help it when men want to talk to me&mdash;now can
I?  If I get half-a-dozen men round me, even
though we're only talking about the simplest
thing, he doesn't like it.  Of course it makes it
awfully awkward for me socially."
</p>

<p>
"It must," responded Conrad; "yes, I can
understand that."
</p>

<p>
"I tell him he should have married a different
woman."  She giggled.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but how unreasonable of you!" he said.
"Then&mdash;if they won't mind being disturbed&mdash;I
am really to see your children?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they won't mind at all, but I'm afraid
you'll find them very untidy&mdash;they've just been
having high jinks."
</p>

<p>
She led him to them presently, and slammed the
door behind her.  It shook his thoughts to the
clergyman's description of Mrs. Page.  Heredity
again, perhaps.  Two girls of about twelve or
fourteen years of age and a boy in a pinafore were
sitting at a table.  At their mother and the
visitor's entrance, they all took their hands off the
cloth and stared.
</p>

<p>
"And so this is the family?" cried Conrad,
trying to sound enthusiastic.  "How do you do?
And will you say 'how do you do' to me, my little
man?"
</p>

<p>
Three limp hands flopped to him in turn, and
he stood contemplating the group, while the lady
cooed silly questions to them, and elicited dull,
constrained replies.  They were not attractive
children; they were indeed singularly uninteresting
children&mdash;even for other people's, whose virtues
seldom strike us vividly.  To Conrad, who failed
to allow sufficiently for their shyness, they
appeared stupidity personified.  "Yes," and "No,"
they answered; and their eyes were round, and
their mouths ajar.  Like all children, from the
lower to the middle classes inclusive, they
proclaimed instantaneously the social stratum of their
parents.  With a monosyllable a child will do this.
It is by no means impossible for a man to
exchange remarks with a girl from a show-room,
and at the end of five minutes to be still uncertain
to what class she belongs.  But when the intrusive
little cub in the sailor suit romps up to her,
he betrays the listless beauty's entourage with the
first slovenly words he drops.
</p>

<p>
"Have your cousins any children, Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "oh yes, they have three or
four each."  He was speculating what individuality
lay concealed behind the vacant fronts.
Their mother had been no older than the eldest
when he was sick with romance for her&mdash;oh,
positively "romance," although its expression had
been ludicrous in that period.  Was it possible
that these meaningless little girls also had
precocity and sweethearts?  Appalling thought&mdash;had
Mary been so unpleasant?  Had he idealised
a dirty mouth?
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see them.  I wish Nina
and&mdash;er&mdash;'Gina would come over one morning to
lunch."  Her tone was painfully eager.  "Or
I might look them up.  Do you know their
'days'?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he murmured, "I can't say I do.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they'll come with you next time?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope you'll see them sooner; it's more than
likely I go back to Paris in a day or two&mdash;I only
left a few weeks ago.  I may remain there through
the year."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, really?" she exclaimed.  "Then you
have no business in London?  Mary," she broke
off impatiently, "what is it?  What is Ferdie
fidgeting about for&mdash;what does he want?"
</p>

<p>
"Jam, ma," said the plainer of the girls in a
whisper.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?  Do speak up, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Jam, ma," repeated her daughter; "he wants
jam on the first piece."
</p>

<p>
"Well, give him it then.  Only this once, now,
darling.  You shouldn't tease him so,
Mary&mdash;remember he's a very little boy."
</p>

<p>
Mary <i>minor</i> leant towards him, and Conrad
thought she muttered "Little pig!"
</p>

<p>
"Then you have nothing to do in London?"
resumed the lady, as he followed her from the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Quite all that I hoped to do in London I have
done this afternoon," he smiled.  "As a matter
of fact, I don't suppose I shall call on anybody
else before I leave."  But he saw clearly that she
wanted to know the women who were "high up,"
and he was self-reproachful.  Distressed, he
wished that he had made no reference to them in
his letter.
</p>

<p>
"Sha'n't you even go to see your cousins?"
she persisted.  "But you say you're not sure if
they're in town?  If they are, any day would suit
me.  If they would drop me a line&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "I'm not sure; I haven't
heard from either of them since they left
Sweetbay."  He was at the point of mentioning Nina's
address; he reminded himself that he had a duty
to Nina too.
</p>

<p>
Yet a moment later he succumbed.  The remembrance
of what he had written, even civility
itself, prevented his parrying so keen an aim as
Mrs. Barchester-Bailey's.  He mentioned the
address, and he said how pretty the plain
children were, and regretted that her husband was
not in.  He sat smiling at boredom for five
minutes longer, and when he escaped at last
he had the reward of knowing that she thought
he admired her very much.  He had owed her
that.
</p>

<p>
As he felt the air in his lungs he thanked heaven.
Well, he would explain the occurrence to Nina,
who would consider him an idiot, and tell her to
expect a speedy visit.  The rest lay with the visitor
herself&mdash;with her powers to please.  For his
own part, never, never did he want to see her
again.  He walked fast, her image still pursuing
him.  What an exhausting woman!
</p>

<p>
He dined at his club and wondered if it would
be bad taste for so new a member to make a
complaint to the committee.  Afterwards he drifted
into a music-hall, where quailing brutes who had
been created to scamper on four legs were
distorted to maintain a smirking brute who was
unworthy to walk on two.  The animals' sufferings
diverted the audience vastly, and the applause
sickened Conrad more than the club dinner.
</p>

<p>
And though his disappointment at Tooting may
sound a very trivial matter, it continued to depress
him.  He was sad, not because one woman was
different from what he had hoped to find her, but
because the difference in the one woman typified
so much that seemed pathetic to him in life.  And
to sneer at him as a sentimentalist absorbed by
opal-tinted sorrows blown of indolence, would not
be conclusive.  It is, of course, natural that those
of us who have to struggle should set up the Man
of Leisure as a figure to be pelted with
precepts&mdash;indeed, we pelt so hard at the silver spoon in
his mouth that between the shies we might well
reflect that Ethics is often an <i>alias</i> of Envy&mdash;but
with Conrad the leisure was quite recent and the
sentiment had ached for years.  In his case wealth
had not formed a temperament, wealth had simply
freed it.
</p>

<p>
Let us accept him as he was.  My business is to
present, not to defend.  Were tales tellable only
when the "hero" fulfilled both definitions of the
word, reviewers would have less to do.  If I could
draw, a frontispiece should enlist your sympathies
for him: "Conrad and the Coquette;" for that
is Youth&mdash;a laughing jilt showing us her heels,
and tempting over her dimpled shoulder as she
flies.
</p>

<p>
This is where you begin to think me insufferably
dull.  I see your fair brow clouding, I can see
your beautiful lips shaping to say, "Oh, bother!"  Be
patient with me; we have arrived at a brief
interval in which nothing particular happened.
It is true that soon afterwards Conrad went to
Monte Carlo, but details would not interest you
in the least.  Be gracious to me; yield to the book
another finger-tip&mdash;I feel it slipping.  Say,
"Poor drivel as it is, a man has written it in the
hope of pleasing me."  For he has indeed.  On
many a fine morning I have plodded when I would
rather have sunned myself where the band played;
on many an evening I have wound my feet round
the legs of the table and budged not, when the
next room and a new novel&mdash;paid for and
unopened&mdash;wooed me as with a siren song.  And
all to win a smile from You.
</p>

<p>
I have thought of you so often, and wanted to
know you; you don't realise how I have longed to
meet you&mdash;to listen to you, to have you lift the
veil that hides your mind from me.  Sometimes in
a crowd I have fancied I caught a glimpse of you;
I can't explain&mdash;the poise of the head, a look in
the eyes, there was something that hinted it was
You.  And in a whirlwind of an instant it almost
seemed that you would recognise me; but you said
no word&mdash;you passed, a secret from me still.  To
yourself where you are sitting you are just a
charming woman, with "a local habitation and a
name;" but to me you are not Miss or Madam,
not M. or N., you are a Power, and I have sought
you by a name you have not heard&mdash;you are my
Public.
</p>

<p>
And O my Lady, I am speaking to you!  I feel
your presence in my senses, though you are far
away, and I can't hear your answer.  I do wrong
to speak like this; I may be arraigned for
speaking; I have broken laws for the honour of
addressing you&mdash;among all the men who have
worshipped you, has one done more?&mdash;and I will
never offend again.  But in this breathless minute
while I dare, I would say: "Remember that
overleaf, and in every line unto the end I shall be
picturing <i>you</i>, working for you, trembling lest <i>you</i>
frown."  Unto the End.  Forgive me.  I have
sinned, but I exult&mdash;it is as if I had touched your
hand across the page.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Conrad drifted from the Riviera with the rest,
and lingered through June in Paris; not on the
left bank this time&mdash;in the Paris of the
Boulevards and the Bois, where he was a world away
from the quarter where he had run to clasp the
illusions of his youth, and stayed to mourn them.
Although he was finding life pleasant, there were
moments when he looked at the bridges, and felt
wistful; but he never crossed one&mdash;he knew now
that he could not walk over the Pont Neuf into
the Past.
</p>

<p>
Nor was it with any definite purpose that he
returned to London.  Amusement, agreeable society
had lulled that desire to revisit old scenes.
And his experiments had been such failures: the
endeavour to recapture his fervour as an
art-student; the ludicrous attempt to revive in cynical
adults the buoyant comradery of childhood; the
interest in the little girl whom time had turned into
the least interesting of women&mdash;it was with a
mental blush that he recalled these follies.  If he
thought no less tenderly of his youth, he thought
of it less often; if he was still liable to a sense of
bereavement, he was now idling as conventionally
as any other man of his class.
</p>

<p>
He arrived in London while the sun shone, and
told the cabman to drive to the Carlton, where
some Americans whom he liked in Monte Carlo
had talked of staying.  After he had made himself
presentable, he descended to the palm court, and
ordered tea, since tea was in evidence, and glanced
round the groups that sipped and chatted.  His
Americans were not there&mdash;perhaps they had
been faithful to the American hotel.  By-and-by
he inquired about them, and learnt that they were
unknown.  He was hipped, for they had been
companionable, and one of the women was very
pretty.  He felt rather "out of it" among the
dawdling groups.
</p>

<p>
During dinner he asked himself to what theatre
he should go.  He remembered reading recently
that a farcical comedy had scored a great success,
and decided to go to see that.  One of his oddities
was a reluctance to inconvenience people by passing
in front of them in a theatre after the curtain
had risen, so he didn't dally at the table.  The
piece began at a quarter past eight.  He had a cup
of coffee, and a red Grand Marnier, and slid into
a hansom.  There would be just time to smoke a
cigarette comfortably during the drive.
</p>

<p>
Hansoms darted everywhere in the pale
evening&mdash;a man and a friend, a man and a girl, a
man going to meet a girl.  From Pall Mall the line
of liveries rolled up endlessly, the broughams and
landaus flashing glimpses of coiffures, and jewelled
ears, and flowers.  Where a block occurred in the
traffic, a young man, who had paused on the curb,
in a dress-suit that looked rather tight for him,
bowed delightedly to the occupants of a victoria,
and they beamed in response.  The encounter was
gratifying on both sides, for the young man had
not often occasion to put on a dress-suit, and his
acquaintances had not long acquired a carriage.
Conrad, who missed the humour of the incident,
was again sensible of loneliness in an atmosphere
where everybody seemed to know someone but
himself.  But as he passed a barrow at the corner
of a side street he appreciated the humour of a
costermonger shouting, "Liedy, I can sell you
some o' the finest cherries that was ever brought
into this country!"
</p>

<p>
When he entered the house the overture was
being played, and as he squeezed towards his
chair a faint hope rose of discerning his Monte
Carlo companions among the audience.  He sat
down, between a lady with a moustache and a
youth who was trying to cultivate one, and scanned
the profiles that were visible, but there was none
he recognised.
</p>

<p>
The attendants were still busy; in his velvet
fauteuil he watched the arrivals almost as eagerly
as the Poor had watched them on the pavement.
What white backs the women had when they
slipped them out of their cloaks! he wondered if
it was safe for them to lean against the seats.
With what geometrical perfection the hair margined
the napes of their slender necks! how did
they do it?
</p>

<p>
The rising excitement of the overture warned
him that it was about to bang to an end.  His
programme had fallen to the floor.  He stooped for it
with the idea of looking at the cast before the
lights were lowered.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the lady in the stall next to him
took out her handkerchief.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
As she did so the curtain went up, and showed a
divided scene.  On the right, the stage represented
the office of a matrimonial agent; on the left, the
office of an agent who obtained "reliable evidence
for divorce."  But Conrad was not attending.
The two careers were followed by the same person
under different names&mdash;his introductions in the
first capacity led to business in the second.  He
explained this soon after he bustled on, and the
audience laughed.  But Conrad did not hear.  The
lady still held her handkerchief, a scrap of lawn
and lace that was scented with chypre&mdash;and he
had been heaved to Rouen and was seventeen
years old there, by the side of The Woman We
Never Forget.
</p>

<p>
For in the life of every man, whether he will
own it or not, there is at least one unmentioned
woman whom he never permanently forgets while
he keeps his faculties.  She may not be the best, or
the prettiest, or even the nicest woman he has
loved&mdash;not her virtues, but his madness, graved
so deep&mdash;and he will take the impression out
sometimes when he has lost his figure and his hair,
and when a boy who is storing experiences on his
own account calls him "the governor."  No, her
qualities have as little to do with the matter as the
date on her birth certificate.  A woman isn't her
age, or herself; she is what she makes us feel&mdash;like
art, and nature, like a musical phrase, or a
line of words, like everything of suggestion and
mystery.  The woman her husband hates and her
lover adores, is an equally vivid personality to
both men.  That to herself she is vividly a third
character makes no difference to the view of either
of them.
</p>

<p>
To say that on the few occasions Conrad had
smelt chypre during the last twenty years it had
never failed to "remind" him of Mrs. Adaile&mdash;to
say this would be to imply that he yielded himself
leisurely to reverie, and it would sound truer
than the truth.  But the fact is that there was
nothing voluntary at all in what occurred.  It was a
physical swirl that the smell always caused him,
and it left him vibrant for a few seconds with the
very craving, the very sickness of the time when
he had worshipped her.  He often thought of her,
even strummed a song she used to sing, but in such
moments as these he was less conscious of thinking
than of feeling.  Normally he looked back at her,
with the reflections of a man; when he smelt
chypre he was near her again, with the tremors of
a boy.
</p>

<p>
Life is less consistent than fiction, even than
tolerably bad fiction.  "What perfume do you
use?" wrote Maupassant to a correspondent
whom he had not seen, but who had made him
curious.  Her answer&mdash;if it hadn't been
"none"&mdash;would have meant a thousand times more to
him than it would mean to the man in the crowd,
but it might very easily have misled him too.  In
fiction, Conrad was dimly aware, Mrs. Adaile and
chypre would never have been associated; it
wasn't faint enough, fresh enough, it wasn't
matutinal enough for Mrs. Adaile; to one who had
not seen her it could never be evocative.
Yet&mdash;perhaps it had been a passing fancy, even an
experiment&mdash;in some days that were immortal to
him chypre had been her scent.
</p>

<p>
The piece became funny by-and-by, and he began
to listen to it, but though the sensations
wakened by the lady's handkerchief subsided, the
memories did no more than doze.  Between the
acts, and when he left the theatre, they beset him
with full force.  As he strolled to the club, he
surrendered to them.  He had recalled Mrs. Adaile
so often, so often re-enacted scenes with her, and
mocked himself that he had not played them
differently, that the episode seemed to him by no
means so remote as it was; it seemed much closer
than many episodes that had happened since.  It
was with a shock in the reading-room that he
counted the years.  Was it possible?  Good
heavens! how time flew.  It indicates the fervour
of his mood to say that when he made this
reflection it had to him a sense of novelty.
</p>

<p>
Then she must be&mdash;Again "Good heavens!"  That
girl!&mdash;for she had been but a girl, although
she was married and he had felt himself a child
beside her.  He remembered the afternoon when
she came to the hotel and he told his people that
"the most beautiful woman he had ever seen"
had just arrived.  Well, she figured still as one
of the most beautiful women he had ever seen.
But was that twenty years ago?
</p>

<p>
What a babe he had been!  And he used to
believe himself sapient for his age....  Well,
perhaps in some things!  How stupid he must have
seemed to her for a boy of seventeen!  Yet she
used to confide in him on the terrace.  He could
not have seemed so stupid to her after all? ... Innocent.
</p>

<p>
That night on the terrace&mdash;always the terrace,
it appeared!&mdash;when she let him hold her hand,
and bent her face to him, saying, "A mosquito has
bitten me on the cheek&mdash;look."  As if it were
yesterday he could remember how his heart
pounded, and the fatuous words he muttered in
his tight throat.  He wished forcefully now that
he had had the courage!  What atom of difference
would it make to-day?  Yet he did wish that
he had had the courage.  O imbecile! ... But
how exquisite it all was; if it could only come over
again!
</p>

<p>
There were no more than two men besides
himself in the room; one of them was reading, and
the other slept.  The silence was absolute until a
page sped in to bawl the name of a member who
wasn't there, and sped forth to bawl for him
somewhere else.  The man who had slept said
"damn" very softly, and turned to sleep on the
other side.
</p>

<p>
Conrad lay back in the deep chair, and let fancy
reign.  There were many gaps, but there were
moments that made the calendar unreal.  He
remembered intimately things that she had said to
him&mdash;oddly enough, more of the things that he
had said to her.  He stared at his whisky-and-potash,
and mentally relived the story.  And this
is the story he relived:&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
The boy came to the French windows paint-smeared
and tired.  He had been to Bonsecours,
where the monument of Jeanne D'Arc is now, and
tried to make a study of the landscape from the
Cemetery.  On the boat&mdash;they had no dream of
electric trams then&mdash;the immensity of his failure
had filled him with alarm.  A tall, slight woman
was standing in the salon, with her back to him.
She wore a pale coloured travelling coat, and a
hat with a wing in it.  As his step sounded on the
terrace she turned, and he forgot the landscape.
He passed awkwardly, and was troubled afterwards
by the thought that he should have bowed.
</p>

<p>
He said to his mother: "The most beautiful
woman you've ever seen is downstairs; I wonder
if she means to stay."
</p>

<p>
"She <i>is</i> staying," answered his mother.  "She's
Grice Adaile's wife&mdash;the man who made that
speech in the House the other day.  Well, is
Bonsecours worth going to?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather!" he said.  He was still thinking of
the woman's delicate, wistful face.
</p>

<p>
He thought of it while he dressed for dinner.
He had thought of nothing latterly but that he
would be studying art in Paris soon, had wished
for nothing but to escape before his parents could
withdraw their consent.  All at once he would
have regretted to learn that he was leaving
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
At table she was opposite him; she sat next to
Miss McGuire.  He perceived that they were
friends and was dismayed, for Miss McGuire
considered he had been impertinent to her and no
longer spoke to him.  He recognised blankly that
the beautiful woman would be told he was a cub.
</p>

<p>
If he had done wrong his punishment had
overtaken him: Mrs. Adaile vouchsafed no word to
him for days.  Her disapproval humbled him so
much that he used to leave the salon when she
was laughing with his mother and the rest.  He
hoped she would observe he was humiliated, and
be stirred with pity; it seemed to him he must
awaken her respect by the course he was adopting.
Incongruously there was an element of
unacknowledged joy in his distress; it was not without its
exultation, to think that Mrs. Adaile was being
heartless to him&mdash;to feel that she was making
him suffer.
</p>

<p>
But it was with thanksgiving he heard that Miss
McGuire had said she wished he would apologise;
she had forbidden him to address her.  He
followed her from the dining-room, and begged her
pardon in the hall.  She replied: "You're a nice
boy really; I'm so glad you've said you're
sorry."  He wanted to tell her that he appreciated
her kindness, but he could only falter, and grip her
hand.  It discomfited him to know that he was
blushing.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon he was sitting on the terrace,
with a sketching-block on his knees, and
Mrs. Adaile came out through the windows.  She
sauntered to and fro.  He couldn't lift his eyelids
when she approached, but each time he listened,
tense with the frou-frou of her skirt.  All his
consciousness was strung to the question whether she
would stop.
</p>

<p>
"May I look?" she said.
</p>

<p>
The sensation was in his chest&mdash;he felt as if
his chest had gone.  She stood there, amused by
his symptoms, for two or three minutes, and
moved away.  He was incredibly excited, boundlessly
happy until he began to think of the better
answers he might have made.  Visions of the
evening and the morrow dazzled him; when he
went inside it was not the same hotel to him, they
were not the same rooms.  It does not take
a woman six days to create a world for any man.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the week he talked to her often
and freely.  At the end of a fortnight:
</p>

<p>
"I used to be afraid you'd never say anything
at all to me," he owned.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you weren't very nice," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Miss McGuire told you things about me?"
</p>

<p>
"She told me as soon as you apologised to her,
too.  I was pleased you did that, even if you
weren't in the wrong."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you ever have taken any notice of
me if I hadn't?"
</p>

<p>
"I did notice you," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Did you?  But 'ever spoken to me,' I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  We shouldn't have been such
good friends as we are.  I've never liked any boy
as I like you, Con."
</p>

<p>
He ached to tell her how infinitely grateful he
felt, but he could not find a word.  They walked
up and down together.  Perhaps she understood.
On a sudden he thought how cruel it was that the
end would come when he went to Paris, or when
she went to England.  In that moment instinct
taught the lad as remorselessly as experience
teaches man.  He <i>knew</i> their friendship was the
merest incident to her, and the hurtfulness of the
knowledge squeezed his throat.
</p>

<p>
"If we meet again one day, you'll give me a
stiff little bow and pass by," he blurted.
</p>

<p>
"Con!" she murmured.  "Why, I've become
chummier here with you in a little while than I
am with people I've known at home for years."
</p>

<p>
Still instinct was heavy in the boy.
</p>

<p>
He always spent the morning out of doors with
his brushes; soon he found himself restless during
the morning, impatient to return to the hotel.
And he did not know he was in love with her.  It
did not occur to him as possible he could be in
love with her.  He had absolutely no suspicion.
</p>

<p>
It was still more extraordinary because he had
so often thought he was in love, and gloried in
being so; when we are very young, half the pleasure
of being miserable about a girl consists of
exciting comment, and pretending to be offended by
it.  Yet no idea of falling in love with Mrs. Adaile
had crossed his mind.  Perhaps it was because she
was married.  Perhaps it was because he was for
the first time really in love.
</p>

<p>
Through most of the stages the boy went
without an inkling of his complaint.  One day his
father said to him, "You've caught it very badly,
Con," and laughed a warning.  The boy was
startled.  He went away bewildered, and asked
himself if it was true.  When Mrs. Adaile sat
with him on the terrace that night he was
self-conscious and husky.  For once her presence was
scarcely welcome.  It rather frightened him,
though he would have died sooner than admit the
shameful word to himself.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards he did not know how it came to
pass, but she used to confide to him that her
husband wasn't very kind to her.  He was in
London, and she sighed when she referred to going
home.  Her sighs were very plaintive, and her
self-pity was sincere, but it was nothing to the
pity that overwhelmed the boy.
</p>

<p>
"People don't guess how unhappy I am," she
said to him one evening.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I were a woman," he muttered; "I can
never tell you how sorry I am for you, and if I
were a woman I could put my arms round you,
and you'd know."
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful thing to say, but he said it
badly, because he felt it too much to make it
effective.  No woman should deride a boy's love.  It
is ludicrous, but it is ludicrous only because it is
so genuine.  He has not learnt yet to trick the
truth out.  He does not know yet that before one
could make converts to the very truths of God
they had to be presented with art.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea when you'll go?" she inquired.
He was to travel with a friend, who was
visiting in England.
</p>

<p>
"I may get a letter any day," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Are you in a hurry?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were?"
</p>

<p>
He was dumb.
</p>

<p>
"I've been quite loyal to you&mdash;I haven't said
a word of what I think to your people when
they've talked of you."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you wouldn't.  It only needs a word
to make them back out."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't let you go if <i>I</i> were your mother.
Supposing I did spoil it all for you?  How you'd
hate me!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I shouldn't," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Have you changed your mind,
then&mdash;don't you want to go after all?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't hate you, because I couldn't hate
you whatever you did," he explained, haltingly.
"Yes, of course I want to go, but&mdash;but I don't
want to go yet."
</p>

<p>
They sat down, and there was a pause.  In the
pause, his consciousness of her presence grew
queerly acute, almost painful.
</p>

<p>
"What's the scent you've got on?" he asked,
unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
"Chypre," she said; "do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
She played with a ring she wore, and showed
it to him.  He touched the ring&mdash;and in a tumult
of the spirit was holding her hand.  They sat
silent again.  He knew that he ought to say
something, that she was waiting for him to say
something, that his long silence was ridiculous&mdash;and
he could think of nothing to say.  He was at once
tremulous with joy and faint with fear&mdash;the fear
that she would withdraw her hand before his
effort had wrenched out words.
</p>

<p>
She withdrew it.  He gazed before him blankly.
When he was a man, and recalled that evening, he
wondered whether the atmosphere had seemed so
much a part of his emotions at the time as it did
in looking back.  He wondered whether, in his
heartthrobs and his sickness, he had been acutely
conscious of the black shrubs in the moonlight, of
all the soft sounds and odours that stole up on the
air.  He thought not.  Yet long after her features,
which he tried to vitalise, were hazy to him,
he could still see clearly the position that the two
chairs had occupied, could have sketched the
terrace almost with the accuracy of a plan, and felt
the night air of Rouen in his throat.
</p>

<p>
Presently she said:
</p>

<p>
"The head-waiter thinks some people who came
from Italy must have brought the mosquitoes in
their luggage."
</p>

<p>
"Oh?" said the boy.
</p>

<p>
"I believe this is a mosquito bite on my cheek,"
she added.  "Look!"
</p>

<p>
She turned her cheek, and leant forward.  He
leant forward too.  Her face had never been so
close to him, his fingers craved its softness&mdash;he
only realised that, with courage, he might touch it
with a finger.  And the courage was not there.
</p>

<p>
"My hand is cold," he said, hoarsely.  And
afterwards, too, he used to wonder whether he
had been excusing his cowardice to himself, or to her.
</p>

<p>
And yet it was with no abashment that he
tramped his bedroom later.  It was with an exaltation
that panted for vast solitudes.  The whirl of
the unexpected was in his being.  The marvel of
her hand, the marvel that she had let him hold her
hand, uplifted him beyond belief.  And through all
the turbulence of his pulses and his mind there was
not a carnal thought, not an instant's base imagining.
He adored her without desire, without reflection,
without asking what he adored.
</p>

<p>
When he was alone with her once more during
some minutes he tried, trembling, to examine the
ring again.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said gently; "it's wrong."
</p>

<p>
And in the next few days nothing happened, one
day was like another.
</p>

<p>
Then the date of his departure was settled.  He
looked for her as soon as he read the news, sought
her dismayed because he was to go, and twice
unhappy because on his last evening she would be
out.  She was shopping, and he met her at the
corner of la Rue Thiers, where the horlogerie is.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going," he said; "and my chum can't
stay here!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it fixed?"  Her eyes were startled.  He
had never known her eyes were quite so blue.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's travelling at night, and won't break
the journey.  I'm to be at the station."
</p>

<p>
At six in the morning he was to be at the
station&mdash;the next morning but one.  The train reaches
Rouen at an earlier hour now, but the service was
a tidal one twenty years ago.  When she had
scanned the letter neither of them spoke for&mdash;it
seemed a long time to him.  They had crossed the
road into the Solférino Garden, and he stood beside
her with his hands thrust in his jacket pockets,
staring at the little lake.
</p>

<p>
"So we shall soon be saying 'good-bye,'" she
said at last.
</p>

<p>
He nodded miserably.  "To-morrow evening
about nine o'clock," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why so early?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you forgotten you're going to a dance
with Miss McGuire to-morrow night?  <i>I</i> didn't
forget; I thought of it directly I saw the date.
What time shall you begin to dress?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't know me very well, Con, after all,"
she murmured.
</p>

<p>
His heart leapt; he pretended not to understand
what she meant.
</p>

<p>
"Don't I?" he asked; "why not?"
</p>

<p>
"How could you think I'd go out on your last
night here?" she answered.
</p>

<p>
"You won't go? ... Oh, Mrs. Adaile!"
</p>

<p>
And as they moved away under the horse-chestnut
blossom, it was less dreadful to him that
he was going to leave her.
</p>

<p>
Why did she do it?  It could not have been to
test her power over him; it could not have been
to wound him wantonly.  Who shall say why she
did it!  A woman is often unable to define her
motive to herself.  Two men came into the hotel
after dinner&mdash;acquaintances both&mdash;and she became
engrossed by them, and sent up little peals of
laughter, and seemed to like their admiration,
which was presumptuously barefaced.  He sat
tongue-tied in a corner, unwittingly providing equal
entertainment for other women in the room.
Though she knew he was suffering, she threw no
glance to him.  And that evening the boy entered
on another stage&mdash;the stage of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
The fires of jealousy are always horrible, and
there is none they ravage more fiercely than the
lad whose torture the world finds comic.  There
is none, because no man, nor woman, nor young
girl in such a pass, is so totally defenceless as a
lad; to none other than a lad, when his love is
outraged, does nature forbid even the resource of
simulated dignity.  His torments are intensified
by the knowledge of his ineptitude.  Always
present is the thought that he ought to adopt an
attitude which he is too raw to discover, and he is
prostrated in perceiving that beside his glib rival
he looks ridiculous and a lout.
</p>

<p>
After a clock had struck many times, "She
makes herself too cheap," Mrs. Van Buren said
<i>sotto voce</i>, and Madame de Lavardens assented
by a grimace.  The boy overheard, and got up,
and wandered away.  A new misery tightened his
throat, and burned behind his eyeballs.  She had
been disdained! his world rocked.  He was
degraded, vicariously&mdash;for her sake, degraded that
his Ideal should afford these people the opportunity
to disparage her.  Resentment beat in him;
he longed to vindicate, to lay down his life for
her&mdash;and knew himself a cipher, and that the
tempest in his soul would be thought absurd.
Disdained!  It was paramount, bitterest.  The
humiliation of neglect dwindled; all his pain, all his
consciousness was the hurricane of humiliation
that he felt for <i>her</i>.
</p>

<p>
"If you weren't so young I should think you
were trying to insult me, Conrad.  Please don't
speak to me any more," she said next morning,
when he had made tactless, seventeen-year-old
reproaches to her.
</p>

<p>
Her voice and gaze were cold, as if he were a
stranger.  She rose and left him.  The grace of
the slender figure had no mercy in it as he watched.
The sun was streaming, and the birds chirped
loud, and he thought his heart was broken as he
watched.  He sat looking the way that she had
gone for long after the terrace was bare.  And
heavy hours passed emptily, and he was still
bereft.  And it was his last day here.
</p>

<p>
Half of it was lost when wretchedness waylaid
her at a door.  "I'm sorry," he gulped.  She bent
her head, and moved by him without speaking.
In the group about the tea-table she was no gentler.
The glare of sunshine mellowed.  His father
claimed him, and talked with unusual earnestness
of ambition and of life; his mother wrapt his arm
about her waist, and was pathetic and confident
by turn.  In the chatter of the salon he heard that
Mrs. Adaile was going to the dance.  From herself
he had still no word or look.  The flush in the
sky faded.  A relentless star peered forth.  And
it was his last day here.
</p>

<p>
She went.  Until the final minutes he could not
feel that she would go, could not believe it until
he saw her in the triumphant cruelty of her ball
gown with the lilies at her dazzling breast&mdash;saw
her giddily with the long gloves and the fan in her
hands.
</p>

<p>
The room was full of animation, of movement.
The boy sat mute, his gaze fastened on her face.
The fiacre grated to the curb.  Miss McGuire
asked her if she was ready.  "Yes, I'm ready."  Colonel
Van Buren put the cape about her shoulders.
She turned carelessly, her hand outstretched:
"Well, I'll say 'good-bye,' Con; you've all my
good wishes."  "Good-bye, Mrs. Adaile," he
faltered.  His eyes implored her, but her touch was
fleeting.  The fiacre rattled&mdash;she had gone.
</p>

<p>
And upon the hotel fell a profound and deathly
silence.  He heard nothing.  Damp he was, and
blind.
</p>

<p>
He had seen her for the last time.  He kept
saying it.  It seemed unreal&mdash;an impossible
thing&mdash;though the harrowing of it was so actual.  His
mind wouldn't seize it, even while the weight of
it was grinding his youth.
</p>

<p>
For the last time!  Outside, he bit hard upon
his nether lip, to check its silly quivering.  A
myriad stars glittered over Rouen now; a breeze was
blowing across the river.  There was a roll of
wheels approaching.  Foolish as he knew the hope
to be, he waited strained till they rolled past.  At
the piano Miss Digby-Smith was playing Ascher's
"Alice."  His mother joined him, and sat there
with him&mdash;and scarcely spoke.  She took his
hand.  He thought she didn't guess.
</p>

<p>
"It's late, Con," she said at last.  "Hadn't
you better go to bed?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not tired," said the boy.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come to my room as soon as you're
dressed in the morning?"
</p>

<p>
"You won't be able to go to sleep again."
</p>

<p>
"I want you to.  Your father's going to the
station with you, do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he told me ... What time"&mdash;the indifference
of his tone!&mdash;"what time do you think
Miss McGuire and&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Adaile will be
back?"
</p>

<p>
"Not for hours yet," she said; "I daresay it
will be three or four o'clock."  She looked away
from him.  He thought she didn't guess!
</p>

<p>
Presently the lights were turned out.  People
said "good-night," and bade him "good-bye."  But
for very shame he would have sat alone in
the salon till it was time for him to start&mdash;sat
there just to see the woman pass through the
hall.
</p>

<p>
In his bed he listened&mdash;he lay in the darkness
listening, holding his breath.  He wanted to hear
her come home; to hear her would be something.
The wind was rising, and alternately it tricked and
terrorised him; he trembled lest a gust should
drown the faint stir of her return.  It was a long,
long while that he had listened.  Sleep pressed
upon his eyelids, but he would not yield.  Once it
was mastering him, and he twitched to wide
wakefulness in the guilty fear that he had missed
her.
</p>

<p>
The blustering wind, and the clock of St. Ouen
made the only sounds.
</p>

<p>
He saw the door opening with the dim notion
that he was being called too soon.  For a mere
vague moment, which seemed dishonour to him in
the next, he beheld without realising her.  He
raised himself slowly on his elbows, and it thrilled
through him that she was moving to his side.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to say 'good-bye' to you, Con."
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Adaile!"  The name was all that he
could whisper.  "Oh, Mrs. Adaile!"
</p>

<p>
"I've been horrid to you.  Haven't I?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he said strenuously, "it was I; I
want to beg your pardon.  Forgive me!  Oh, you
do forgive me, don't you?  It's been awful."
</p>

<p>
Her hands were swift and live; he held them
fast.  The ghostliness of daybreak was in the
room.  In the pallor she sat at the edge of the
bed, the ball gown wan, and the faded lilies
drooping at her breast.  Being so young, he was shy
that his hair was on end and the collar of his
nightshirt crumpled.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said; "I've been sorry all
the night."
</p>

<p>
Her penitence started his tears, and blinking
wouldn't keep them back.  He wanted to smear
them away, but he didn't want to let go her hands.
He turned his head.  He was ashamed&mdash;but less
ashamed than he would have expected&mdash;that she
should see him blub.
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" she said, and he had never heard
that note before.  "You'll make me hate myself."
</p>

<p>
"I love you," he exclaimed, "I love you."
</p>

<p>
"Sh!  You mustn't say that, Con," she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"I love you, I love you," cried the boy.
</p>

<p>
"I know," she said, "I know you do."
</p>

<p>
And, wonderfully, there was nothing wonderful
to his mind that he had owned it to her.  At the
instant there was nothing but perfect peace.
</p>

<p>
"You've made me so happy," he breathed.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards that sounded to her a little funny,
but as she heard him say it she thought it only
strange and beautiful.  Something tenderer than
liking, something graver came into her gaze as she
looked down at him.
</p>

<p>
"I've not been a nice woman to you, Con," she
said.  "One day you'll think so."
</p>

<p>
"I shall never think so," he vowed, "never.
I deserved you should punish me."
</p>

<p>
But that wasn't what she had meant.  "You
will think so."  She nodded.  "Only you won't
mind then, because you'll laugh at it all."
</p>

<p>
"You're cruel," he choked.  "Because I'm
not a man you think I can't love you really.  No
man could love you better than I do.  If I could
only tell you what I feel!  I'd die for you, I'd do
anything for you.  Oh, Mrs. Adaile, I shall never
see you any more&mdash;for God's sake let me kiss
you once!"
</p>

<p>
Quick as her compassion was, the misgiving of
a boy was quicker&mdash;in the dizzy second that he
saw her bending to him he wondered how he ought
to hold her.  Then her bosom fell upon his
breathlessness, and he went to Heaven against her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," she said, freeing herself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, don't," he begged, "not yet."
</p>

<p>
"I must; I oughtn't to have come up."
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do?" he groaned.  "Oh, it's
awful to be leaving you!"
</p>

<p>
"I wish I hadn't made you fond of me," she
sighed.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't; you couldn't help it.  But what
shall I do?  My life's no good to me; I shall be
thinking of you, and longing for you when you've
forgotten all about me."
</p>

<p>
She smoothed the ruffled hair.
</p>

<p>
"Think of me sometimes when you've got over
it," she said; "think of me when you're going to
do anything that isn't worthy of you now."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be true to you as long as I live," said
the boy, understanding.  "Mrs. Adaile&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It was odd to her ear that he called her that
a moment after she had been in his arms.
"What?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"When you go down to breakfast, <i>I</i> shall be in
Paris."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you read the papers by the window this
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I should be able to know where you were."
</p>

<p>
"I will then."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be imagining you all the time....
What shall you do this evening?"
</p>

<p>
"Reproach myself," she said.
</p>

<p>
"No, you mustn't; what for?  Will you think
of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  After dinner I'll go on the terrace,
Con, and I'll sit there alone, wondering what
you're doing, and thinking of&mdash;just now.  And&mdash;well,
perhaps I'll say a little prayer for you.
I <i>must</i> go now.  Say 'good-bye' to me."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," he gasped, "I can't."
</p>

<p>
"Con, I must."
</p>

<p>
"Give me something," he stammered; "give
me something you've got on."
</p>

<p>
She broke off a handful of the flowers they had
crushed, and, stooping, took his strained face
between her palms, and kissed him twice&mdash;once on
the lips, and, by impulse, on the brow.  Then she
opened the door cautiously.  She smiled back at
him, and stole away into the passage.  And in the
loneliness she left behind her, the boy lay kissing
her lilies, and sobbing with his great despair.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
Across twenty years a man made an obeisance to
a woman for risking what she had risked that she
might comfort a boy's pain.  Conrad got up from
the club chair and crossed over to the bookcase.
He pulled out the Post Office Directory&mdash;and
it sprawled open on the top shelf.  Would he
find the name under "A?" ... "Grice Ewart
Adaile, M.P., 62 Norfolk Street, Park Lane."  And
she?  Was she alive? could she be there, so
close to him as that?
</p>

<p>
He mourned to think how different she must
be to-day.  The woman had changed, and the boy
had changed, and though he didn't know it, the
town had changed the most.  The ubiquitous rush
and whir of electric trams, the ceaseless clangour
of their bells beating through the brain, had turned
peace into a pandemonium.  Rouen had acquired
all the noise of New York without any of its
gaiety.  Telegraph wires and telephone wires
spanned the tops of the churches, and a mesh-work
of iron ropes obscured the sky.
</p>

<p>
He strolled to Norfolk Street the next afternoon.
There was a half hope in his mind of finding
a carriage at the door waiting to take the lady
for her drive.  If Mrs. Adaile came out&mdash;Oh, if
Mrs. Adaile came out he would be well repaid; it
would be exciting to recognise her, although she
wouldn't recognise him!
</p>

<p>
But she did not come out.  The door was shut
fast, and no familiar face happened to gaze
pensively over the window boxes.  He was
disappointed.  In the evening he went to another
theatre.  The hero of the comedy was supposed
to be a man of his own age, and talked about
himself as if he were a centenarian.  He said he was
thirty-seven and had "lived his life," and he called
the heroine "Child."  His hair was silvered at the
temples, and he depressed Conrad exceedingly.
</p>

<p>
The situation of Norfolk Street was so convenient,
however, that Conrad took to passing through
it rather often.  And though he was old enough to
know better, he certainly looked young enough to
be the hero's son.  One day he found the windows
of No. 62 blank behind shutters.  So the family
had left town!  He sauntered on, and hesitated,
and went back.  Here was an opportunity to
ascertain what he wanted to know.  He rang the
bell, and asked a solemn functionary when
Mrs. Adaile was expected home.
</p>

<p>
"I can't say, sir," said the man; "Mrs. Adaile
is on the Continent."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Conrad, with a heart-prank.  She
did live!  He vacillated&mdash;and obeyed a
second impulse; "Can you give me Mrs. Adaile's
address?"
</p>

<p>
The solemn person noted the pearl in the
stranger's tie, the silk lining of the coat he
unbuttoned, and the direction in which his hand was
travelling.  Mrs. Adaile was in Ostend.  "Thenk
you, sir."  He named the hotel, and Conrad
proceeded to Piccadilly enamoured of temptation.
How tired he was of London!  In any case he
would go away; why shouldn't he go to Ostend?
He had never been there&mdash;and he might sit next
to her at dinner.  It would be an absurdity of
course, but&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The hero of thirty-seven with hair silvered at
the temples, admonished him from every hoarding
and he took a hansom to avoid his sedate
contemporary's reproof.  Entering the club, he
walked through an avenue of decorators' ladders;
the smoking-room was full of paint and pails.
What could be more absurd than to remain in town?
</p>

<p>
He winced as it occurred to him that Adaile
might have been married twice.  Supposing the
"Mrs. Adaile" in Ostend proved to be a stranger,
an unfamiliar person profaning a hallowed name?
How complete a fool he would feel when he
arrived!  But he would not dwell on that
contingency.  "Far fetched," he said.  Even a fate that
showered disappointments as freely as if they were
confetti must draw the line somewhere.
</p>

<p>
He was among the tourists, and the luggage-thieves
at Charing Cross by ten o'clock next morning.
When he reached Ostend it was a fine afternoon,
and the town was baking.  By comparison
London had been pleasant, so a multitude of
Londoners had flocked to Ostend.  With trepidation
he beheld the hotel that sheltered her&mdash;what if
he were unable to obtain a room in it?  But
no&mdash;so far, so good.  Fate was, perhaps, napping in
the heat&mdash;a room was to be had.  He washed his
face in No. 17 victoriously, and overlooked the
scarlet geraniums, and the Faience fountain,
glistening in a grass plot, and the red-striped
sun-umbrellas that sprouted through the little tables.
Nobody was visible among the basket chairs.  A
starling's twittering in a lilac bush, was the only
voice.  The number of his room chimed with
his mood&mdash;a happy coincidence.  To the manager's
mind, at least, he was "seventeen" again.
Again he stood in an hotel bedroom preparing
to join her downstairs!  Had she changed <i>very</i> much?
</p>

<p>
Presently he wandered into the salon, and
lounged round the reading-room.  Everywhere it
was unpromisingly quiet.  A hint of siesta
pervaded the hotel.  Should he go out?  He sauntered
through the hall, but the dazzle of the Plage
blistering in the glare made his eyes ache.  He
went back to the shade, and ruffled newspapers,
and smoked cigarettes.  A child came into the
scorching courtyard that was called a "garden,"
and hopped round on one leg, and said to another
child, "Can you do that?"  The starling twittered
imperturbably.  Who said Ostend was gay?
</p>

<p>
Benighted male! the women weren't asleep,
they were all changing their frocks again.  When
he woke he had missed one of the sights of the
day&mdash;the "creations" that vie with another
between five o'clock and seven.  A gong was
booming.  Only the first gong.  Good!  There was time
for him to dress before the room began to fill.  He
sought the head-waiter, and inquired if a place
facing the door could be arranged.  The
headwaiter had house property, and two sons at
college, but he was the urbanest of head-waiters.  A
novice tips the servants when he leaves an hotel,
and, if he is a generous novice, pays for attention
which he hasn't received; a traveller of experience
tips them when he arrives, and gets the liver
wing and a seat by the window.
</p>

<p>
The second gong was still reverberating when
No. 17 descended to dinner.  The urbanest of
head-waiters hovered on the threshold.  For
scrutinising the company Conrad had scarcely time to
glance at the menu.  The doorway was as
dazzling as the Plage had been: a cinematograph of
toilettes, a succession of audacities&mdash;only clusters
of diamonds seemed to keep some of the bodices
up.  Man formed a shifting background to an
exhibition of jewels, a pageant of skirts and
breasts.  Still more gowns.  The humming room
was the apotheosis of Clothes&mdash;until the women
sat down, and then it was the apotheosis of Bosom.
</p>

<p>
She came in late.  She wore white satin,
embroidered in silver, and a "collar" of emeralds.
He recognised her at once.  There was no hesitation
in his mind&mdash;he had expected to hesitate&mdash;he
knew her the instant she appeared.  She had
altered certainly&mdash;even pathetically; the girl of
twenty years ago was lost; but in the flash of the
moment the difference in her face startled him less
than the difference in her figure.  A shade too
stout.  Yes, a shade too stout for his taste!
And&mdash;and <i>had</i> her hair been copper colour in Rouen?
</p>

<p>
But a pretty woman, nobody could deny it.  She
didn't look a day more than thirty-five&mdash;might
pass for thirty now the rose glow of the lamps was
on her! ... Well&mdash;almost!
</p>

<p>
Her table was well in view.  She was with
another woman&mdash;perhaps younger, a brunette,
vivacious&mdash;and an elderly man with projecting
teeth, and eyes like a fish.  Adaile?  How
grotesque he must have looked making love!  He had
a nose as long as the one in Blake's portrait of
the man who built the Pyramids.  And he used to
be unkind to her!&mdash;one could read that he was
a cold-blooded, unappreciative stick....  Now
he was talking to her.  On second thoughts,
perhaps he wasn't her husband&mdash;he displayed the
projecting teeth to her in so many smiles.  The
other woman's husband then!  Quite a good chap
in his way, no doubt.  He was doing them very
well in the matter of wine.
</p>

<p>
Would there be a chance to speak to her
to-night?  Abominably hard lines if he had to wait
till to-morrow, but he wanted to find her
alone&mdash;in the garden, for preference, in the moonlight....
No&mdash;no&mdash;thirty-five; but no more, not
an hour.  How beautiful she <i>used to be</i>!  She
didn't know she was sitting in the room with a
man she had kissed.  Rather an amusing reflection
that! ... Scores of men in the room, though;
perhaps she did.  How sick he would have felt
to think so once!  Where was the splendid
jealousy he ought to feel this evening?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Dead as the bulrushes round little Moses<br />
  On the old banks of the Nile!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He made his coffee last till the party got up,
and then followed them to the salon.  The salon
did not keep them&mdash;they drifted to the hall.
They disappeared.  The hall was a bevy of women
who had been upstairs to put on hats, and were
desiring to be taken to the Kursaal.  "Poppa"
was in constant demand.  Conrad observed that
all the family men seemed inclined to loll where
they were, and that all the unaccompanied men
made sprightly departures.  In the concert-room
he found her again, but he didn't find his
opportunity.  To be sure, he had hardly expected one
there.  Still he felt rather hipped the last thing
at night as he sat among a crowd, and the popping
of champagne corks, in a buffet where the casks
were utilised as seats, and the ladies' toilettes were
as gorgeous&mdash;and as modest&mdash;as the ladies'
toilettes in the hotel.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he met her coming back from the
sands with an enormous sunshade, in the "early
bath" costume; and he met her later wearing a
picture hat in the "after bath" costume: also he
saw her in the costume she put on when <i>déjeuner</i>
was over&mdash;and still she was unapproachable.  If
she proved too elusive, he'd be tempted to swim
after her next day and try his luck in the water.
But could he be sentimental with his hair dripping?
And even in Ostend it wouldn't be&mdash;Oh, in the
wrong key altogether!
</p>

<p>
She was scribbling on a picture postcard at one
of the little writing tables, and there was nobody
else there.
</p>

<p>
"May I remind Mrs. Adaile that I have had
the happiness of being presented to her?"
</p>

<p>
She turned her head, and there was approval
in the lady's gaze.  There was, however, not a
scintilla of recognition in it.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Warrener," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," she murmured; "I'm so short-sighted&mdash;&mdash;how
d'ye do?"  But he saw that
she was twenty years away from knowing who he
was.
</p>

<p>
"This is tremendously nice of you," he
exclaimed; "I was afraid you wouldn't remember me."
</p>

<p>
"How absurd!" she said perfunctorily.  "Why
shouldn't I?  We met at&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"But so long ago.  I <i>was</i> afraid, really.  I've
been warning myself that you couldn't be expected
to remember&mdash;and yet I knew I should be so
pained if you forgot."
</p>

<p>
She made a little amiable movement of her
hands.  He understood it to signify that his doubts
had done injustice to them both.  Inwardly he
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Is your husband in Ostend, Mrs. Adaile?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "no, he's in the Tyrol&mdash;Innsbruck.
I'm here with my sister and my
brother-in-law.  You know them, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I've never had the pleasure.  They
weren't with you there."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, no," she said, "no, they weren't....
Ostend is very dull this year, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I've found it very exciting; I saw you yesterday
at dinner, and I've been trying to meet your
eyes ever since."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" said the lady.  She allowed him to
meet them, and looked away, her expression
vacillating between a pucker and a smile.
</p>

<p>
"My courage wasn't equal to risking a snub
from you publicly, and you were never alone.
You balked me last night, you escaped me this
morning, and you drove me to desperation this
afternoon.  I ought to have known you wouldn't
forget, but I always had misgivings, hadn't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Had you?" she said.  The pucker was getting
the upper hand.  She played with the postcard.
</p>

<p>
"Confess!" said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"I remember you perfectly," she insisted with
transparent hypocrisy, "but just for the moment
I'm fogged where it was we met."
</p>

<p>
"Will it help me if I mention Normandy?"
</p>

<p>
"Normandy?" she echoed vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"Rouen&mdash;the Hôtel Britannique&mdash;a boy who
was called 'Con.'"
</p>

<p>
"Con?" she cried.  And the smile had things
all its own way with her; for an instant the spirit
of his youth flashed so close that he nearly
captured it.  "You are 'Con?'"
</p>

<p>
"Still," he affirmed earnestly.  "And you are
still&mdash;Mrs. Adaile."
</p>

<p>
"You are Con," she repeated, wondering, "that
boy!  And did you remember me directly you saw
me last night?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;I've remembered you all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," she laughed reproval, "what a long
while ago that makes it seem!&mdash;the boy never
told me pretty falsehoods."
</p>

<p>
"The boy never told you half the truth; he
was a very backward boy."
</p>

<p>
"If we are to be friends you mustn't run
him down, Mr. Warrener," she said; "I was
very fond of Con....  'Rouen!' Have you
ever been there since?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I was abroad for years&mdash;out of Europe,
I mean."
</p>

<p>
"You were going to be an artist?"
</p>

<p>
"I hoped to be."
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"No; I haven't the artist's temperament&mdash;I'm
too constant."
</p>

<p>
She regarded the postcard on the table again,
and he did justice to her eyelashes.
</p>

<p>
"Ostend is going down dreadfully, isn't it?"
she remarked.  "All the ridiculous people who
have just got titles have brought them here.
We're leaving on Thursday."
</p>

<p>
He sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be foolish," she said, not too flippantly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Conrad now, "what a long while
ago that makes it seem!&mdash;the boy was not told he
was foolish."
</p>

<p>
"No one could be so unkind to him&mdash;and he
wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"You'll make me jealous of that boy before
you've done.  Don't you believe you could?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"You used to take <i>him</i> seriously."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, we were capital friends."
</p>

<p>
"Did he deserve your friendship more than I?"
</p>

<p>
"You're absurd," she smiled.  Her eyes were
as blue as they had been in the Solférino Garden.
He looked into them, wishing he could feel the
despair that had been his that radiant morning.
</p>

<p>
"Is a wretched boy you only knew for a few
weeks to be privileged above a man who has
thought of you for years?"  Within an ace he
had said "for twenty years," but the blunder was
nipped in time.
</p>

<p>
"You mean 'hours,'" she said.  "We dined
last night at eight o'clock&mdash;it's just four
now."
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe me&mdash;you think I'm making
the most of a happy accident?  What if I
gave you a conclusive, an overwhelming proof?"
</p>

<p>
"A proof of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of what?  That I am constancy itself!  Supposing
I told you that my only reason for coming
here was to see you again.  What would you say
to that?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope I should answer quite politely," she
murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you didn't doubt me once!" he exclaimed
with grave reproach.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't tell such tarra-diddles once," she
urged.
</p>

<p>
"I came here simply and solely to see you.
Look at me.  Will you give me your hand?&mdash;I
want to repeat it solemnly."  She glanced at the
door, and yielded him her hand.  It was very
soft and agreeable to hold; he continued with no
undue haste: "Now, holding your hand, and with
my eyes meeting yours, I say that I came here to
see you&mdash;for no one, and nothing else&mdash;that
I had no idea of coming to the place till I knew
you were here.  That isn't all!" he detained her
hand gently.  "For an age I have been trying to
see you.  I knew none of your friends&mdash;it was
awfully difficult for me.  Could I call upon you
and begin 'Once upon a time?'  Should I write
to you?  You might read my note in the wrong
mood.  Oh, I tell you I racked my brains!  That
isn't all!"&mdash;her hand had been retreating again.
"The day before yesterday as I passed your
house&mdash;No. 62; you have window boxes, the flowers
are calceolarias and marguerites this season&mdash;the
day before yesterday as I passed, I saw the shutters
were closed.  I rang the bell.  I deceived
your servant, I led him to imagine you&mdash;you
would be glad to welcome me.  I wormed your
address from him and threw myself onto the boat
rejoicing.  That isn't all&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She drew the hand free, nevertheless, and
realising that it wasn't coming back to him yet, he
concluded, "But it is enough to show you that
you've been cruel."
</p>

<p>
At this moment they were interrupted, and she
said, "Oh, let me&mdash;Mr. Warrener, my sister,
Lady Bletchworth."
</p>

<p>
"How d' ye do," said Lady Bletchworth.  "Ostend
is very dull this year, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I've just said that," Mrs. Adaile told her.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," said Lady Bletchworth.
"It's a very good opening remark, and I make it
to everybody."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you put me up to the correct answer?"
asked Conrad; "I've only just come, and I should
like to catch the tone."
</p>

<p>
"Most of them say, 'Oh, my <i>dear</i>!'" she replied;
"but our latest novelty is, '<i>South</i>end!
What?'"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener's people and I used to be very
chummy ages ago," said Mrs. Adaile.  "I am
afraid to inquire, Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "I&mdash;I am alone."
</p>

<p>
"He was quite nice in those days," she added
to her sister.
</p>

<p>
"What has spoilt you, Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"I find my world so sceptical, Lady Bletchworth."
</p>

<p>
"Not here," she said; "they can even believe
Ostend is smart.  Can you do a sum?  If 'it
takes three generations to make a gentleman,' how
many shops does it take to make a knight?"
</p>

<p>
"One: England," said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe he's spoilt after all, Joan,"
said Lady Bletchworth.  "There's hope for him
yet."
</p>

<p>
"It's much too early to say <i>that</i>," murmured
Mrs. Adaile.  But the glance she cast at him was
not discouraging.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
The rest of the afternoon promised nothing, so
Conrad bought "Le Marquis de Priola" to kill
time.  It passed away so peacefully that he was
surprised when he found it was dead.
</p>

<p>
After dinner he saw the two women on a
lounge, and they moved their skirts for him, and
commented on the visitors.  There was the Earl
of Armoury, wearing a stud as big as a brooch, and
a Malmaison the size of a saucer.  He made
grimaces like Arthur Roberts, and when he sang
"Pip, pip! the Lodger and the Twins," Society
found him as funny as Harry Randall.  As
everybody knows, the Duke of Merstham married
Flossie Coburg from the music halls; the heir had
inherited his mother's gift.  "The best of it,"
said Lady Bletchworth, "is that his mother
herself has become too prim for words since she has
been respectable.  She asks bishops to dinner, and
does her hair in plain bands.  Heredity is her
cross!  Oh," she went on, "you'll meet all the
world and his wife&mdash;Ostend-sibly.  A man
brought his wife to the hotel last week, and when
he went upstairs to bed she wasn't there.  After
he had searched high and low for her he went
to the bureau, and asked the clerk if he could tell
him where she was.  The clerk hadn't an idea,
but said that a married lady came to him a little
while ago in a fix&mdash;she didn't know the number
of her room, and she had forgotten the name of
her husband.  Please don't smile, I was terribly
shocked myself."
</p>

<p>
Conrad didn't say that the story was not original,
and had been told about town six months
before.
</p>

<p>
Then Lord Bletchworth drifted to them, and
was tedious.  Lord Bletchworth twaddled
ponderously.  He considered there was a lot of
disgraceful bosh being printed about the Service, and
the Country at large, in the papers just now.  My
dear sir, an Englishman who had the interests
of England at heart would hold his tongue while
she slid down hill, and silently watch her bump to
the bottom.  That wasn't how he put it, but it
was the gist of what he said.  He added that the
battle of Waterloo had been won on the playing
fields of Eton, and he seemed as satisfied with
Waterloo as if it were situated in the Transvaal.
</p>

<p>
However, he had his uses&mdash;he walked with his
wife when they went to the Kursaal, and left
Conrad with Mrs. Adaile.
</p>

<p>
"How quiet you've become," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I am asking myself what to say to you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you find me so hard to talk to?"
</p>

<p>
"I find you so hard to convince."
</p>

<p>
"Why try to convince me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why did I come to Ostend?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that was a pretty tale," she said.  "It
wasn't true, really, was it?"
</p>

<p>
"You know it was true.  I've looked forward
to meeting you again for years.  I can't tell you
how fond I was of you.  You're the only woman
I've ever cared for."
</p>

<p>
"You were a child."
</p>

<p>
"And now I'm a man&mdash;doesn't that show,
doesn't it prove?  Is it nothing to think of a
woman so long as I've thought of you?  What
other man could say to you what <i>I</i> can say?"
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>mustn't</i> say it," she smiled&mdash;it
cannot be written that she "forbade."
</p>

<p>
"Is your life so full," he asked, "that you have
no room for my love?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener, but really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You hurt me," he said.  "What have I done
since we parted, to become 'Mr. Warrener' to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Are we going to sit on the terrace," said
Lord Bletchworth, looking back, "or are we going
inside?  Mr. Warrener, you play, perhaps?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Conrad, "I haven't played here.
I don't care much about it anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"Let's sit down outside," said Lady Bletchworth.
"It's so hot in there."
</p>

<p>
On the terrace it was very agreeable.  The
orchestra did not sound too insistent, and they
found chairs where they could watch the people
promenade without being inconvenienced by them.
Extremes meet, and Ostend is their meeting-place.
Only a light railing divides the fashionable world,
and the half world from the world that works.  On
one side plod a humble flock of wearied trippers,
who have had tea "As nice as mother makes it,"
in a sweltering shop at the back of the town.
Among the shell pin-cushions, the franc souvenirs,
they have had tea.  All the evening they pass and
repass with flagging feet, wishing they had chosen
Margate.  On the other side, women who were
born in the same class trail Paquin's gowns.  On
the necks of some there are flowers that have cost
as much as a tripper's holiday; a diamond in an
ear is worth more than the price of a tripper's
home.  And Maggie from Dalston, with three
tired children clinging to her ten-and-sixpenny
skirt, gazes across that slender rail, and thinks.
And her thoughts might be unpleasant to hear.
</p>

<p>
A really extraordinary thing was that no one
but Conrad seemed aware that the railing bisected
two worlds and a half.  As for Conrad his
reflections engrossed him so much that he quite forgot
to attend to Mrs. Adaile.  Only when he chanced
to notice she was looking pensive in the starlight
did it occur to him that he was ignoring a situation
by which he ought to be thrilled.
</p>

<p>
For here they were.  The stars were twinkling,
the waves were murmuring, the lady was waiting.
It was true her sister and Bletchworth were in
the way, but even allowing for their presence this
should mean emotion.  Where was it?  On the
terrace while he made small talk, and on the
Plage when they strolled back, and as he smoked
his last cigar that night in the garden, the question
in Conrad's mind was insistently "Where is the
emotion?"
</p>

<p>
Because she was still an attractive woman, and
he perceived it.  He was even making love to
her&mdash;to <i>her</i>, to Mrs. Adaile!&mdash;and she was not
adamant.  What had happened to him?  Where
were his transports, the spiritual whirlwinds,
where was everything that he had travelled to
recover?
</p>

<p>
She had a whim to do fancy work in the salon
next day during the hour when the women changed
their déjeuner dresses for the five-o'clock-to-seven
costumes.  He had met her as she was passing
his door&mdash;their rooms were in the same
passage&mdash;and they had gone downstairs together.
</p>

<p>
"You've told me nothing of your life since
we used to know each other," he said, playing
with a thimble.
</p>

<p>
"What would you like me to tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"You used to tell me a good deal&mdash;if I am
privileged to remember it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I did.  How I must have bored
you!  It was rather a shame.  But I was in my
egotistical stage, and you listened with such big
eyes&mdash;Con."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Conrad.  "But I wasn't
bored.  And you weren't an egotist&mdash;you were
the sweetest woman I've ever met.  I was awfully
sorry for you&mdash;so sorry!  Only a cub's
sympathy, but you've had none truer from anyone."
</p>

<p>
"You were a nice boy&mdash;I've thought about
you sometimes.  Are the scissors there?  Do
look."
</p>

<p>
"If a woman knows when she is really loved,
you should have thought about me very often,"
he answered, giving them to her.  "Are you
happier than you were?"
</p>

<p>
"Let us say I don't worry so much about being
unhappy.  I suppose it amounts to the same
thing."  She sighed&mdash;and smiled.  "Would you do this
leaf green, or yellow?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't do it at all," he said.  "Put it
down and talk to me.  I remember once when you
were telling me your troubles, you cried.  It was
one afternoon on the terrace; you had on a pale
blue frock, and a big floppy hat.  I'd have given
my life to kiss you at that moment."
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't say these things to me," she
faltered.  She said it more gravely than on the
Plage; she was not smiling now, and she lowered
her eyes&mdash;he knew that he might seize her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I've waited for you so long," he exclaimed.
"Joan, be kind to me!"
</p>

<p>
But his heart did not thud in her silence.  He
held her hands fast; the doyley she was making
had fallen to the couch.
</p>

<p>
At last she murmured, still looking down,
"How can you care for me?  We've only just met."
</p>

<p>
"I've cared for you ever since.  If you knew
how I worshipped you&mdash;if you knew what I
suffered when you were vexed with me!  That night
you sat talking to those men, and the next
morning when you were offended&mdash;I remember what
I felt as if it were a month ago.  I remember
what you said as you turned away, and how I sat
watching, praying that you'd come back.  And
then I waited at the door, and begged your
pardon, and you wouldn't forgive me.  I've relived
it all so often.  I did love you, darling, I did,
I did! ... It sounds idiotic: there was a song of
yours, 'To-day, to-day our dream is over&mdash;To-day
the waking cold and grey'; I learnt to strum
the refrain there to&mdash;to make me feel nearer to
you when I had gone.  Since I've been a man I've
strummed that refrain a hundred times, and longed
for you&mdash;I was strumming it years after you had
forgotten you ever sang it.  I've thought about
you sometimes till my boyhood has been alive in
me, trembling.  If Faust's chance could have come
to me in any year since we parted, I'd have said
'Let me be seventeen again in Rouen.'"
</p>

<p>
"The past is always beautiful.  I made you
very wretched, though."
</p>

<p>
"But you liked me a little.  Heaven knows
why I&mdash;I was a fool.  Still you did."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it was because you were a 'fool' that
I was foolish.  That's all over."  She drew her
hands from his clasp.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't over," he said.  "You sha'n't say it's
over.  The present may be as beautiful as the past."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head; "Can we work miracles?
Can I make myself a girl again, or you a boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if you've not forgotten what you felt
for me.  If the memories are not all mine, you
can even do that.  You see I'm a fool still;
I&mdash;I half hoped that you'd remember....  Joan,
'you were not once so wise!'"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she said.  "If I were younger now&mdash;or
if you had been older then&mdash;who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"Could you sing that song still?" he asked.
"Listen."  He opened the piano, and played a
few bars.  "Can you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"  She forced a laugh.  "It was too long
ago.  And what a song besides!"
</p>

<p>
"Try," he pleaded.  "Try it!"
</p>

<p>
"I can't remember the words," she murmured
</p>

<p>
"The words?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'You tell me, Love, that I'll forget you&mdash;<br />
  I own it, in our last "good-bye,"'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
I'd be so grateful.  Please!"
</p>

<p>
"How does it go on?"
</p>

<p>
"It goes on&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Our dream has been too sweet to let you<br />
  Remember that I spoke a lie.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Oh yes," she said, coming forward.  She
hummed.  "Let me see!&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I know the years will crowd above you,<br />
  I know despair must fade away;<br />
  But here and now I know I love you,<br />
  I love you&mdash;and we part&mdash;to-day.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Is that it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it; and then there's what I was
playing&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To-day, to-day our dream is over,<br />
  To-day the waking, cold and grey.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She nodded; "Yes, yes&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'What care I Time will&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
something, what is it?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The throes that rend my heart to-day?'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Well, I'll try, but I'm sure I sha'n't be able to.
I haven't heard it for years."
</p>

<p>
Then she sat down, and began it; and he shut
his eyes and tried to think he was seventeen and
she was twenty.
</p>

<p>
The music stopped short.  "I knew it would be
a failure!  It's gone.  It was too long ago," she
repeated.
</p>

<p>
"It was yesterday!" he cried, and caught her
in his arms as she got up.
</p>

<p>
For a second she held him back from her,
regarding him curiously.  Regret, tenderness, irony
were mingled in the gaze she bent on him.  Like
him she mourned for what had perished; like him
she sought to delude herself that it bloomed anew....
"It's absurd," she said, and drooped to him
with a kiss.
</p>

<p>
As they moved apart, both were disappointed.
The man thought, "I have spoilt my memory of
her kiss to me in Rouen."
</p>

<p>
"I adore you," he said mechanically.
</p>

<p>
The woman's smile was enigmatic as she left him.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
"Are you heartless?" he continued; "have you
no pity for me?"
</p>

<p>
It was the next evening.  They were sitting
among the basket chairs and the dinner dresses in
the garden, and there was no one inconveniently
near.  Lady Bletchworth had gone inside a few
minutes before.  A warm breeze bore strains of
Chopin to them from the <i>Kursaal</i>; the little
fountain plashed languidly, and a full moon had been
assisting Conrad to deceive himself.
</p>

<p>
"I am not heartless," returned Mrs. Adaile,
"I am sensible.  And&mdash;there are a thousand
reasons."
</p>

<p>
"For one thing?"
</p>

<p>
"For one thing....  I don't want romance&mdash;I
want comedy.  I want to laugh with you, my
dear Con, not to be serious."
</p>

<p>
This was difficult to answer, for he could not
offer to laugh at his grand passion.  He sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Besides," she went on, "I couldn't make you
happy.  It isn't in my power&mdash;you don't really
care for me.  You are in love with a memory, not
with me.  I'm no longer the woman you fell in
love with.  I've changed.  Really I didn't know
how much I had changed till you came here, I
must like you very much to want to talk to
you&mdash;because you make me feel elderly, you do
indeed."
</p>

<p>
"You're unjust," he exclaimed&mdash;and he was
genuinely distressed.  "Not care for you?  You
don't believe it, you can't believe that.  I swear to
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, don't," she said.  "I can imagine all you
would say.  Haven't I listened to you?  Haven't
I even ... tried to make illusions for myself?
You talk of what you felt for me, not of what you
feel.  You don't know it, but you rave to me about
what I was, not about what I am.  You remember
the hat and the frock I had on twenty years
ago&mdash;can you tell me what I wore last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Is such constancy nothing?" he cried hastily.
</p>

<p>
"It would be irresistible," she said, "if you
could find the girl that you've been constant to.
But she doesn't live, Con&mdash;she's gone.  <i>I</i> am
such a different person from the girl you've
looked for that&mdash;that I've even felt a tiny bit
jealous sometimes of your rhapsodies to me about
her.  Well?  I'm being quite frank with you, you
see.  It's pathetic, I think.  There have been
moments when I've listened to you and felt a little
pained because you seemed to forget all about me....
I am hurting you?"
</p>

<p>
"You hurt me," said Conrad, "because for the
first time I realise you <i>are</i> different from the girl
I've looked for.  Till now I've felt that I was
with her again."
</p>

<p>
"That's nice of you, but it isn't true.  Oh, I
like you for saying it, of course....  If you had
felt it really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"No, what for?  I should only make you
unhappier."
</p>

<p>
"You want comedy?" he demurred; "you
have said the saddest things a woman ever said
to me!"
</p>

<p>
She raised a white shoulder&mdash;with a laugh;
"I never get what I want!"
</p>

<p>
"It should have taught you to feel for me, but
you are not 'wondrous kind.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am more to be pitied than you are!
What have I got in my life?  Friends?  Yes&mdash;to
play bridge with.  My husband?  He delivers
speeches on local option, and climbs mountains.
Both make me deadly tired.  I used to go in for
music&mdash;'God save the King' is the only tune he
knows when he hears it, and he only knows that
because the men take their hats off.  I was
interested in my house at the beginning&mdash;after you've
quarrelled in your house every day for years it
doesn't absorb you to make the mantelpiece look
pretty.  I wanted a child&mdash;well, my sister has
seven! ... Voilà my autobiography up to date."
</p>

<p>
"There is to-morrow," said Conrad, moved.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow you must give me the comedy,"
she smiled; "and the morning after, I go to the
Highlands&mdash;and big men will shoot little birds,
and think it's 'sport.'  Did you ever see a
sparrow die?  I watched one once.  It was human.
Like a child! ... Come on, come on, let's go out!"
</p>

<p>
And behold another woman!  She had been wise,
and dejected him; now she was unwise, to make
amends.  Behold a myriad women in one.  Before
half an hour had passed she had told him her
philosophy was a puff ball, that she had prated reason
only to be reasoned with.  And she told him so
without a word about it&mdash;said so by the modulation
of her voice while they talked trifles.
</p>

<p>
And Conrad?  Conrad had been scrambling to
the point of friendship, and he slipped back to
folly.  Conrad strove to forget that discomfiting
phrase, "You are in love with a memory, not with
me."  It made the folly so difficult.
</p>

<p>
He could not succeed in forgetting it.  It was in
his mind next day, coldly a fact.  Yes, he was
making love to Mrs. Adaile because she was
Mrs. Adaile, not because she was a charming
woman.  He knew that if they hadn't met
before he came to Ostend, he might have admired
her, tried to know her, grown to like her, but that
he would never have said to her what he had said.
Nor wished to say it.
</p>

<p>
Yet there was the regnant truth that it was she.
She had the fascination of sharing with him his
dearest, his sweetest remembrances; the radiance
of the past still tinged her&mdash;in her keeping lay
the wonder of his youth.
</p>

<p>
So they ate Neapolitan ices in the morning,
and she brought down the doyley in the afternoon,
and they listened to Chopin again in the
evening.
</p>

<p>
It was the last evening.  The Bletchworths and
she were leaving early on the morrow, and he was
unlikely to be alone with her again before she
went.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you weren't going," he said.  "How
horribly I shall miss you!  I sha'n't stop here.
Why aren't you going to Homburg, instead of to
people in Scotland?  Then we might have met
again."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to Homburg to be 'cured'?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I shall go there.  Or to Antwerp.
Yes, I shall go to Antwerp first.  I was there when
I was a boy.  I was happy in Antwerp."
</p>

<p>
"How funny you are," she said involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"I've never found anyone much entertained by
me.  How?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll go to Antwerp, of all places in the
world, because you liked it when you were a boy!
Antwerp will disappoint you&mdash;too."
</p>

<p>
"You could always stab deep with a monosyllable,"
he said, "but you used to have more mercy."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I have deteriorated," said the lady
rather stiffly.
</p>

<p>
She leant back in her chair, and a minute passed
in silence.  She gave her attention to the orchestra,
tapping time with the tip of a shoe.
</p>

<p>
"Does it amuse you to say cruel things to me?"
asked Conrad.  "If it does, by all means say what
you like."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you."  She drooped
disdainful eyelids.
</p>

<p>
"What you said was unworthy of you.  You
know it was."
</p>

<p>
"I really forget what I did say.  Please talk
about something else.  What is it they are
playing?"
</p>

<p>
They were playing <i>Cavalleria</i> now, so he
scorned to reply to this otherwise than by a look.
</p>

<p>
"I asked you a question," she said in tones of ice.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he answered hastily.
"They are playing <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>.  An
opera.  Written by a young Italian.  His name is
Mascagni."
</p>

<p>
"You are rude!" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I am human, Joan.  You hurt me!"
</p>

<p>
Then her sister and Bletchworth reappeared.
"Perhaps you know a good hotel?" Conrad was
saying.
</p>

<p>
"An hotel where?" inquired Lady Bletchworth.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener is going to Homburg; I tell
him everybody says it's deadly dull there this
year," murmured Mrs. Adaile.
</p>

<p>
It was deadly dull in Ostend, too, during the
next hour.  Both women were rather quiet, and
Bletchworth was exceptionally wearisome.  But
for the fact that it was the farewell evening
Conrad would have seen friends among the company
and gone to greet them.
</p>

<p>
However, at last the orchestra finished, and
they all got up.  A leisurely crowd was flocking to
the exit, and&mdash;perhaps it was the crowd, perhaps
it was Lady Bletchworth&mdash;Conrad and
Mrs. Adaile were separated from the others for
satisfactory seconds.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you forgive me?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Even a crowd has merits&mdash;her hand rested on
his arm an instant.
</p>

<p>
"It must be fate," he said; "I always offend
you just when we're going to part.  Do you
remember?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "I remember."  Her glance was
very pretty in the moonshine.
</p>

<p>
"This won't be our last talk together?" he
begged.  "What are you going to do when we go
in?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we shall sit in the garden."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;everybody?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect so....  Don't let's keep behind!
Walk with Lily."  She addressed her
brother-in-law, and Conrad sauntered beside Lady
Bletchworth.
</p>

<p>
The windows of the Villa this, and the Villa
that, were thrown wide behind the mass of blooms.
In the crimson dusk of lamp-shades there was the
glint of a white gown, the glow of a cigarette point
among cushions, a bubble of laughter.  Every
minute a dim interior flashed to brightness&mdash;someone
returned and switched on the light, a woman
took off her hat before the mirror.  Through one
window came the jingle of money on a card table;
through another shouts&mdash;Paulette Fleury was
singing to friends one of the songs that she had
not sung at the Empire in London.  To the left,
the track of moonlight on the sea kept pace with
Conrad.
</p>

<p>
It was more agreeable in the garden than on
the terrace at the onset.  Already it had an air of
intimacy, the artificial enclosure, with its tesselated
paving, and its affectation of rusticity; already he
was on good terms with it.  Curiously enough,
such hotel gardens, misnamed as they are, have a
knack of making a visitor feel at home, of endearing
themselves to him, more quickly than acres of
lawns and elms.
</p>

<p>
Lady Bletchworth wanted a brandy-and-soda,
and Conrad had one, too; Mrs. Adaile and
Bletchworth drank champagne.  Presently they
referred to the shooting-box, to the people they
expected to see there.  Almost for the first time
Conrad was blankly sensible of inhabiting a
different sphere; he hoped they wouldn't ask him
if he knew any of the people they were mentioning.
He got very near to his youth in that moment;
there was a revival of his boyhood's dumb
constraint....  How odd it was! they were all
sitting together like this, and after to-night he was
never likely to meet her.  Front doors between
them.  'Gina, of course, might be useful; but how
stupid of him not to have got into the right set in
town when he came back from the Colony!  He
supposed it wouldn't have been difficult, with the
money.  Londoners boasted that everything the
world yielded was to be bought in London, and
it was true&mdash;even to dignities and reputations.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am forced to admit that I don't know
what women go to the moors for," said Bletchworth.
"You don't take the sport seriously, and
therefore you are out of place.  What do you say,
Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can hardly say anything," owned
Conrad; "I <i>don't</i> go to the moors."
</p>

<p>
"But if you did, you wouldn't prefer a grouse
to a woman, I'm sure?" asked Lady Bletchworth.
</p>

<p>
"A man does not go to the moors to talk to
women," insisted her husband.  "That is my
point.  Women always want to flirt just as the
birds are rising.  Women are very desirable at a
dance, but when it comes to birds, or it comes to
cricket, when it comes to anything important, I
say, reluctantly, they can't be serious.  That is my
point&mdash;you don't take the thing seriously.  Now,
at the Eton and Harrow, were you earnest about
it; had you got the matter at heart?  No, no;
all you wanted to do was to walk about, and to
have lunch."
</p>

<p>
"A lot of boys playing ball!" she said.  "And
then they take up all the lawn besides.  So selfish
of them!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Bletchworth warningly, "that is
the tone that is going to do the harm, that is the
tone we have to guard against.  What has made
us what we are?  What has given England the
place she holds?  I protest, I protest absolutely
against irresponsible&mdash;er&mdash;comment.  The foreign
ideas that are creeping into papers that have
always had my&mdash;er&mdash;approval will sap the
country's manhood if we don't make a stand.
Joan&mdash;I am sure Joan agrees with me?"
</p>

<p>
She was leaning back absently, trifling with a
porte-bonheur on her wrist; the blue fire of the
diamonds was ablaze.  It caught Conrad's glance;
from her wrist his gaze travelled to her eyes.
They told him, "I'm so bored."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," she assented, "you're quite
right."  It would have been evident to anyone
but Bletchworth that she had not heard what he
said.
</p>

<p>
There were fewer people in the garden by this
time.  In the knowledge that the evening was
nearly over, a wave of sentiment stirred Conrad.
Even her message of comprehension did nothing
to subdue his annoyance.  What likelihood
remained of a tête-à-tête?  The evening from first
to last had been wasted in stupidities.
</p>

<p>
Presently another group went inside, presently
there was no one left but themselves.  Finally
Lady Bletchworth yawned.  He wished fervently
that she had yawned an hour ago.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's time we all went to bed," she
said.  "You've laid down the law quite enough,
Charlie.  Shall we see you in the morning,
Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," he said, "of course.  What time is
the boat?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know&mdash;ten something, isn't it?
Well, I'll say 'good night.'  I wish we were
staying on, really I do&mdash;I shall have a racking
headache to-morrow evening.  Are you ready, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," said Mrs. Adaile; "<i>I</i> have a headache now."
</p>

<p>
He was hopeless until she let him see her slip
the porte-bonheur into her chair before she rose.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Mr. Warrener."
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Mrs. Adaile," he said.
</p>

<p>
When he was alone he sat down again, and
waited for her return; her manoeuvre might fail,
someone return with her&mdash;the bracelet must be
lying where she had "dropped" it.
</p>

<p>
More than five minutes crept by before a step
sounded.  He turned eagerly, and with dismay
beheld Lord Armoury approaching.  The intruder
gaped at the view, and stood hesitating, with his
hands in his pockets.  It was an instant of the
keenest suspense.  Would he withdraw?  No, he
lounged forward.  He threw himself into the very
chair, and stretched his legs across another.
</p>

<p>
Conrad muttered an anathema on him.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?" said Lord Armoury.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't speak," said Conrad frigidly.
</p>

<p>
The young man took out a cigarette, and opened
his match-box.  It was empty.
</p>

<p>
"Got a light?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I haven't," said Conrad, momentarily
encouraged.
</p>

<p>
"Rotten show!" said the Earl; "where's a
waiter?"  He contemplated his cigarette with a
semi-intoxicated frown, and transferred his feet to
the table.  It was apparent that he meant to stop
although he could not smoke.  With his change of
position he was liable to come in contact with the
bracelet, and Conrad watched him nervously, but
he did not seem to be discommoded by it.
</p>

<p>
"Seen Paulette?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No."  The "no" of a man who is not to be
drawn into conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Pauly's a bit of <i>all</i> right," affirmed the Earl,
undeterred.  "I don't pretend to be up to all the
patter, but&mdash;wot <i>ho</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Speechlessly Conrad hoped the lady wouldn't
come back yet.
</p>

<p>
"Three hundred a week she refused for a
return engagement at the Empire&mdash;told me so
herself to-night.  That's Pauly!  Got the hump.
What's three hundred to Pauly?  I told 'em how
she'd catch on before she went over.  Don't I
know?"  He winked profoundly.  "Look here,
you'll see an artist in October at the Syndicate
halls, that's&mdash;wot <i>ho</i>!  She's going to knock
'em.  Between ourselves she's got some new
'business,' that&mdash;well, it's great!  Never been tried.
I saw her when she was doing the last turn at the
South London.  I said to George, 'Cocky, that's
a winner!'  Robey couldn't see it.  <i>I</i> saw it; I
can put my finger on the talent every time.  She's
going to make Marie sit up, my boy&mdash;she's
another Marie Lloyd.  Don't I <i>know</i>?  I've got the
judgment.  I can spot 'em with one peeper! ... Isn't
there a waiter in this damned hotel?  I could
do with a tiddley.  Where's a bell?"
</p>

<p>
"It's no use ringing," said Conrad, "nobody
ever comes.  It wants someone to go in and stir
them up."
</p>

<p>
But now Mrs. Adaile reappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she murmured.  And then, "I've
dropped a bracelet somewhere; I came down to
look for it.  Good evening, Lord Armoury."
</p>

<p>
"A bracelet?" echoed Conrad with concern.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mrs. Adaile&mdash;a bracelet?
Crumbs!" said Armoury.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, isn't it a nuisance!  I don't know how I
could have lost it&mdash;I suppose the clasp was loose.
I had it on out here."
</p>

<p>
"Let me help you," said Conrad.  In an
undertone he added, "Don't find it yet.  Let's
look further off.  Oh my dearest, it was so
sweet of you!  I'm in such a rage, I'm so
wretched."
</p>

<p>
"Where were you sitting, Mrs. Adaile?" asked
Armoury, peering about.
</p>

<p>
"Over here, over there, I don't know," she said
hurriedly....  "Is it still in the chair?" she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," whispered Conrad.  "Are you sorry
you're going from me?"
</p>

<p>
"A little."
</p>

<p>
"To leave you like this," he sighed, "it's
awful.  Joan&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me come to your room to say 'good-bye.'"
</p>

<p>
She started.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!  Have you got it?" exclaimed Armoury.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "I&mdash;I thought I had."
</p>

<p>
"Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"I daren't," she faltered.  "My maid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come and say 'good-bye' to <i>me</i>, then.  Do!"
</p>

<p>
"Find it!" she said agitatedly&mdash;"he'll guess."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" cried Conrad.  "Here it is&mdash;why,
in one of our chairs!  May I&mdash;?"  He
fastened the bracelet on her wrist.  "Make me
happy.  Come to me," he begged.  "Will you?
Number seventeen."
</p>

<p>
Her fingers touched his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so immensely grateful to you both," she
said serenely.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky for her we were here!" the intruder
remarked when she had gone.  "One of the
servants might have pinched it by the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose it was as well we were here,"
said Conrad amiably.  "If it hadn't been for you,
I should have turned in before this."  He dropped
back into his seat, resigning himself to tedium a
little longer.
</p>

<p>
He lolled there discreetly, making civil
responses&mdash;and gradually he realised that Flossie
Coburg's son was not wholly to be blamed for the
tedium; he recognised that there was a dulness of
his own spirit.  While he countenanced the
garrulity of a fool, his thoughts were with scenes of
twenty years before, and sadly the man strove to
revive in his heart the idolatry and illusions of the
boy.  Oh, for the enchantment of the summer
when he had called her "Mrs. Adaile!" ... If
he could only keep remembering it was the same
woman!  But never had she seemed so different
to him as in these minutes&mdash;never had he desired
so little as now when she had promised all.
</p>

<p>
The ground floor of the hotel was partially
dark when he crossed it; a purposeless waiter
hovered in obscurity.  Upstairs, along the passage,
the tan and black rows of boots, shapely on
boot-trees, indicated that most of the visitors had
retired.  A drowsy lady's-maid put forth an
expectant face, and withdrew it wearily.  Conrad
felt about the wall for the electric button, which
seemed always in a different spot, and found it.
Then he closed his door as completely as was
possible without turning the knob.
</p>

<p>
As he put down his watch he saw that it was
late, but he knew that it was not yet late enough,
and his movements were leisurely.  He wanted a
cigarette&mdash;the more because he had deprived
himself of one outside by saying that he had no
match, but he was reluctant to give the odour of
tobacco to the room.  A superfluous grace,
perhaps, now that most women smoked?  Still he was
reluctant.  He threw down his cigarette-case, too,
and the rest of the things that had been in his
pockets....
</p>

<p>
He looked at himself ruminatingly in the
mirror, and brushed his moustache.
</p>

<p>
One of the lights hung above the pillow&mdash;it
was convenient to read by.  Presently it occurred
to him that nearly two acts of "Le Marquis de
Priola" remained to divert him.  He put forth
his arm for it, and, stretching, reached it.  He
turned the leaves....  <i>Une dame viendra de deux
à trois</i>.  Ah yes, this was as far as he had read.
</p>

<p>
The effort to give his attention to the play grew
gradually less.  Mournfulness faded, and in the
next scene his interest was alert.  Once he laughed.
His thoughts were no longer with the boy who had
lain wakeful through a night just to hear her
footstep in the hall.
</p>

<p>
The wind was rising, and intermittently it
tricked and irritated him.  The blustering wind,
and the chiming of a clock made the only sounds.
</p>

<p>
Again the clock rang out.  This time he counted
the strokes with annoyance.  He yawned.  His
interest was wandering from the play now.  It
began to seem to him that Priola talked too much.
What was keeping her&mdash;had she repented her
promise?  He tossed the book aside, and lay
watching the door.
</p>

<p>
After he had watched it for nearly half-an-hour
it was gently opened, and swiftly closed, and
Mrs. Adaile stood on the threshold.  She paused there
diffidently, with downcast eyes.  She wore a long
clinging robe of crêpe de chine, veiled partly by a
stole of Venetian point.  The sleeves of the deep
toned lace, dividing at the shoulders, drooped from
her like wings.  One daring touch of colour, the
flame of nasturtium, at her breast threw into
dazzling relief the gleaming whiteness of her skin, the
burnished gold of her hair.  She paused, awaiting
doubtless the words of welcome, of encouragement,
that would vanquish her timidity.  But Conrad
slept.  A respiration too loud to be thought
rapture, and too faint to be called a snore, smote
the lady's hearing.  Startled, she looked up;
forked lightning flashed at him from her indignant
eyes.  But, tranquil, Conrad slept.
</p>

<p>
What an offence!  Wasn't it enough to enrage
the sweetest of women?  Put yourself&mdash;I mean
it was unpardonable!
</p>

<p>
For a second she seemed about to escape even
more surreptitiously than she had entered; and
then a smile, half sad, half whimsical, twitched her
lips.  A sense of humour&mdash;how much it spares
us, how far it goes in life!  A little pathetic that
often a sense of humour wins affection, and the
noble qualities get nothing but a dull respect.  She
looked at a pencil-case on the table, and stood
tempted, her fingers at her mouth.  Dared she do
it!  She would not have roused him for a coronet&mdash;and
the creak of a board, even the scratching
of the lead, might be fatal.  She wavered.  She
moved towards the pencil slowly, stealthily, inch
by inch.
</p>

<p>
The table was gained.  There was nothing to
write on.  A paper-covered volume lay to her
hand; with infinite precaution she tore the
title-page.  Tremulously she scribbled, holding her
breath.  Where to leave the message, where to put
it so that it couldn't be overlooked?  Again she
hesitated.  Conrad slept sound, a glance assured
her of it.  Again she ventured.  An instant her
gaze dwelt upon him, still with that smile half
mirthful and half melancholy on her face.  She
nodded, wide-eyed&mdash;and on the tips of her toes
crept out unheard, unseen.
</p>

<p>
When Conrad woke, a servant was admitting
the sunshine through the window; his coffee
steamed by his side.  As he sat up&mdash;and almost
before memory thudded in him&mdash;his view met
the front page of "Le Marquis de Priola" pinned
to the bed-curtain.  He rolled towards it
haggardly.  On it was written:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dreamer</i>!  Good-bye.  There is no way back to Rouen."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
"I must say I was very happy on the stage,"
sighed the Countess of Darlington, lifting the
teapot.
</p>

<p>
The Earl of Armoury's mother threw up her
eyes.  A shapeless, waddling woman, the duchess,
with a sanctimonious voice.  There were elderly
gentlemen who, remembering Flossie's agility with
a tambourine at the old Pavilion, felt reformation
to be a sad affair when they looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Not 'happy,'" she said piously, "dazzled&mdash;only
dazzled, dear Lady Darlington.  Ladies like
you and I can't be happy on the stage.  It goes
against the grain with you and I."
</p>

<p>
Lady Darlington pouted.  She was provokingly
pretty when she pouted.  She had pouted at
Darlington on the day he met her.
</p>

<p>
"But I <i>was</i> happy," she declared.
</p>

<p>
"You weren't satisfied in your heart; I'm sure
you always felt there was better work to be
done?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, but I hoped to get leading parts in
time."
</p>

<p>
"I mean purer work," explained the duchess,
wincing, "social, helpful work."
</p>

<p>
Lady Darlington laughed.  She was prettier
still when she laughed.  She had laughed at
Darlington on the day he proposed.
</p>

<p>
"No, really not," she said frankly, "I never
thought about it for a moment.  Do you know,
Duchess, I've always wanted to ask you&mdash;didn't
you ache to go back to it after you married?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh never," exclaimed the duchess; "I was
grateful to Providence for letting me get away
from it all.  Circumstances made me go into the
business, but I was never a pro&mdash;I mean to say
a 'professional'&mdash;by nature.  My father, the
captain, died when I was quite a child, and I had
my dear mother to support."
</p>

<p>
"M'yes," murmured Lady Darlington, looking
at the ceiling.  "You were before my time, but
of course I've heard....  Perhaps if I had been
in the music-halls <i>I</i> should have been glad to get
away from it all," she added; "I was in the
theatres, you know."
</p>

<p>
"The 'smalls,' I think&mdash;I mean to say the
'minor provincial towns?'" said the duchess a
shade tartly; "one of Jenkinson's Number
II. companies, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Lots of people considered it was better than
the Number I.," returned Lady Darlington with
pride, "and the <i>Rotherham Advertiser</i> said a
voice of such diapason as mine wasn't often heard
in musical comedy."
</p>

<p>
"Such what as yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Diapason.  Won't you have some muffin?"
</p>

<p>
"They always serve me out so," said the
duchess, "but I <i>will</i> have just a mossel."  She
regarded her hostess anxiously; "I hope you
aren't going to be mad?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"I am mad," admitted Rosalind&mdash;her name
was Rosalind&mdash;"mad with the longing for auld
lang syne.  If I weren't crazy I shouldn't own
it, because you can't enter into my feelings a bit,
but you're the only woman I meet who ought to
be able to understand them.  Long?  Sometimes
for a treat I tell the servants I'm not at home to
anyone, and I shut myself up and long the tears
into my eyes!"
</p>

<p>
"You cry for the stage?  Oh, but, my dear
Lady Darlington, you mustn't give way, you must
be firm with yourself.  Think, just think, what an
example you'd be setting if you took to it again!
In our position we have the Country to consider.
The middle classes say 'What's good enough for
the Aristocracy must be good enough for us.'  We
have to consider our influence on those in a
humbler sphere."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going to take to it again," said
Rosalind.  "How can I?  Besides, I don't want so
much to act&mdash;I've no ambition except to be
jolly&mdash;it's the life I ache for.  I'm dull, dull,
dull!  I want to be among the people I remember.
My heart turns back to Dixie.  I wouldn't say
'thank you' to be with actors and actresses in
London, in the West-End; they're only imitations
of the Lords and Ladies that bore me.  I
want to be on the road with a Number II. crowd&mdash;yes,
and a Number III. crowd for preference.
I want to arrive in a hole-and-corner town on a
Sunday night, and have supper in lodgings, and
see stout in a jug again, and call the landlady
'Ma.'  Oh, how soul-stirring it would be to call
a landlady 'Ma!'"
</p>

<p>
"Lodgings?  Look at your drawing-room, with
Louis Cans furniture!" said the duchess
admonishingly.  "You can't be serious?"
</p>

<p>
"Serious?  I'm pathetic!  Of course I should
find I had been spoilt for it&mdash;the pleasure
wouldn't last; the stout would taste sour soon,
and I should find the landlady impudent, and the
lodgings dirty; I daresay I should wish
myself back in St. James' Square before I had
been away a month.  But I don't want to give
up St. James' Square&mdash;I only want a week-end
sometimes as a tonic.  That's all I want, just
week-ends.  If I could be Rosalind Heath again
from Saturday to Monday sometimes, I'd be
Lady Darlington all the rest of the year cheerfully
enough."
</p>

<p>
This was the moment when her Idea was born.
As the idea had consequences, it is noteworthy
that this was the moment.  If she could be
Rosalind Heath again from Saturday to Monday!
She had never debated the possibility; but why
not&mdash;why not even for a week?  She couldn't
call herself "Rosalind Heath" again, because
everybody in Theatre Land knew that Rosalind
Heath had married the Earl of Darlington, but
who among a lowly band of players would know
her face?  She had not been a star.  All she
needed for the freak was a confidante.  What had
become of Tattie Lascelles?
</p>

<p>
Lady Darlington blushed with self-reproach.
That she should have to question what had
become of Tattie!  She sat, after the duchess had
departed, remembering days when she and Tattie
had been bosom friends.  They had shared hopes
and lodgings; they had told each other their
peccadilloes, and even their salaries.  And now
she didn't know where Tattie was?  Could
St. James' Square have made her heartless?  How
had their correspondence died? ... Ah yes, in
Tattie's last letter ages ago she had asked for the
sum of five pounds "just for a fortnight."  But
how monstrous of Tattie to feel constrained
because she hadn't sent it back!  Who had
expected it?
</p>

<p>
On the seventeenth day of December, when
Darlington, looking a ridiculous object, had
boomed away in a new car, of which he was
inordinately proud, Rosalind stole guiltily into a
news-agent's.  She would not meet her lord again
for a month.  Her beautiful eyes sparkled, and
her cheeks were flushed.  She tendered two
pennies to a vulgar man, smoking a clay pipe
behind the counter, and asked for the <i>Stage</i>.  To the
happily constituted there can seem nothing
calculated to kindle the emotions in the act of buying
a twopenny paper in a squalid shop, but Rosalind
had a temperament, and temperaments play queer
tricks.  (See Conrad's.)  The tender grace of a
day that was dead hallowed the damp copy of a
journal in which she had formerly advertised that
she was "Resting;" the touch of vanished hands
sent little thrills to her heart as her gaze embraced
familiar names.
</p>

<p>
She went back to the drawing-room fire, and
read them diligently.  Dusk and a footman crept
in before she discovered Miss Tattie Lascelles,
but that artist's announcement leapt to her with
the electric light.  Miss Tattie Lascelles informed
the kingdom that she was specially engaged to
create the part of "Delicia Potts" in the maritime
musical farce entitled <i>Little Miss Kiss-And-Tell</i>,
on Blithepoint Pier.  The date chosen for
this perfectly unimportant production was
Monday, December 22nd.  Then Rosalind, who was
to go to the Marrables in Leicestershire for
Christmas, wrote Lady Marrable a note of grieved
excuse, and scribbled a letter to Tattie, which began,
"Take two bedrooms in Blithepoint, and don't
breathe a word to a soul till you see me."
</p>

<p>
And though the happily constituted may be
sceptical again, she felt more joyous than she had
done for five illustrious years.
</p>

<p>
Blithepoint is about thirty-three miles by rail
from Sweetbay.  It is a grey, bleak place, with the
plainest female population in England.  On three
hundred days of the year the wind is due east, but
on the other sixty-five it is southeast, and then the
residents go about saying what "lovely weather
they're having."  Blithepoint is much larger than
Sweetbay, and more fashionable.  It is also nearly
as dull.  Nobody is aware how much can be spent
on being deadly dull until he has stayed in a
Blithepoint hotel.  Rosalind was a shade uneasy in the
thought that someone among the visitors might
recognise her; she knew that at Christmas eccentric
Londoners occasionally went down there, and
wished afterwards they had been economical and
gone to Egypt.  But she didn't falter.
</p>

<p>
She ran away on Sunday the 21st.  She had put
on her simplest costume, and her portmanteau told
no tales.  To make-believe to the fullest extent,
she travelled in a third-class compartment.
Already she was greatly excited.  As the train
crawled out of Victoria she could have clapped
her hands.
</p>

<p>
When she arrived it was eight o'clock, and a
bitter evening.  The scramble for luggage kept
her shivering on the platform for ten minutes, and
then a fly bumped her through the shuttered town.
It was the hour of local dissipation; on one side
of the favourite thoroughfare the blades of
Blithepoint paraded jauntily, crying "Pip, pip" to
stolid-faced young women on the other, who took
no notice of them.  Lady Darlington, reckless for
sensations, envied these "roysterers" who could
feel devilish gay so innocently.
</p>

<p>
The cab shaved a corner, and rattled into
a neighbourhood of obscure apartment-houses.
Her mutinous heart warmed with sentiment, and
she forgot how cold her pretty feet were.  The
cab stopped.  She saw the blind of the ground-floor
window dragged aside; an impetuous figure
appeared, and vanished.  The street-door was
pulled wide, and a girl with a cloud of hair, and
a string of barbaric beads dangling to the waist,
flew down the steps and hugged her.
</p>

<p>
"You trump!  You've really come!"
</p>

<p>
"You duck!  How jolly to see you!"
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, two bob, missie," said the flyman,
"when you've done canoodling."
</p>

<p>
They ran into the parlour, and laughed at each
other in the gaslight.
</p>

<p>
"Take your things off," said Tattie: "let me
help you.  I hope you'll like the diggings.  I
wrote to the swellest address I could hear of, when
I got your letter."
</p>

<p>
"But you shouldn't have.  What for?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, for you."
</p>

<p>
"I wanted everything just as it used to be.
That was it."
</p>

<p>
"How funny!  But I don't suppose these will
strike you as very swagger after what you've got
at home."
</p>

<p>
"They don't."
</p>

<p>
"Won't they be good enough?"
</p>

<p>
"They're heavenly.  Oh, Tattie, how good it
is to be back!  Did anybody bring in my trunk?
'In the Shade of the Palm,' and a Vocal Folio
on the piano!  And professional photographs on
the shelf!  Oh, let me see the photographs!
'To Mrs. Cheney from Miss Bijou
Chamberlain&mdash;wishing you a Merry Christmas.'  Who is
she?"
</p>

<p>
"She was here last week&mdash;a Variety artist.
She seems to have been comfortable, as she gave
the landlady her photograph.  Are you ready for
supper?"
</p>

<p>
"Stout?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"In a jug?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I thought after what you had come
from I had better order Guinness."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Rosalind looked downcast.
"Ah well, never mind," she said; "we'll have
it in a jug to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
They drew their chairs to the ham-and-beef,
and the landlady brought in the Guinness.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Ma," said Rosalind, with
youth in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, my dear," said Mrs. Cheney.
"You'll be glad of your supper, I daresay, after
your journey?"  She put comestibles on the table
in three paper bags.  "I was meaning to tell you,
Miss Lascelles, that if you'd like a bit of
something hot in the evening when you come back from
the show, you can have it.  I'm not one to fuss
about hotting something up.  Sundays we let the
fire out, but in the week you can have it and
welcome."
</p>

<p>
"Good business!" said Miss Lascelles.  "In
some places you 'get it hot' if you ask for it."
</p>

<p>
"By rights some places shouldn't take
professionals," returned Mrs. Cheney.  "I've 'eard
many tales.  Miss Chamberlain&mdash;her on the
mantelpiece&mdash;was telling me that where she was
in Brighton they wouldn't allow her to have her
uncle in to see her.  Such a quiet, ladylike gal,
too!"
</p>

<p>
"Can such things be?" cried Rosalind.  "Is a
poor girl to be cut off from her own flesh and
blood because she's in diggings?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I don't wonder at your asking!" said
Mrs. Cheney.  "Not, mind you," she added, "but
what letting lodgings over a number of years
makes one a bit suspicious of uncles.  I've known
a gentleman brought to these very rooms after
the show on three different Monday evenings as
the uncle of three different young ladies.  And
dreadful taken aback he was when he see me each
time!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid those were flighty girls," said
Rosalind severely.
</p>

<p>
"Untruthful they was," said Mrs. Cheney,
"and so I told 'em.  I say nothing about visitors,
I'm not that evil-minded.  So long as the lady
pays a bit extra for the gas, and the gentleman
don't slam the door when he goes, I like to think
well of everyone.  But I 'ate lies."
</p>

<p>
She drew the cork, and retired; and Rosalind
said, "Well, what about the show, Tat?  What
sort of part have you got?"
</p>

<p>
"The part's rather good," said Miss Lascelles.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  What screw?"
</p>

<p>
"Rotten&mdash;thirty-five shillings.  I had to take
what I could get; I've been 'out' a long time.
They're paying awful salaries in this crowd; the
chorus only get about fifteen bob, I believe&mdash;they're
half of them novices."
</p>

<p>
"I say!  Whose crowd is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a Syndicate; nobody ever heard of it
before.  And the Tenor has such a cold he could
hardly speak at the dress-rehearsal last
night&mdash;goodness knows how he's going to sing to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Who is your principal woman?"
</p>

<p>
"She has backed out; they've put somebody
else into the part at the last minute.  And the
scenery has still to come down&mdash;it's a bit of a
muddle all round.  I wish I could have got into a
better thing, but I was so hard up&mdash;you ought
to have seen where I was lodging!  I tried to
get 'shopped' last month as an Extra.  That
speaks!"
</p>

<p>
"An Extra?  No?  Tat! why didn't you write
to me?" exclaimed Rosalind reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  I heard the 'great' Miss
Hayward wanted thirty Extra-ladies to go on in
the ball scene.  It was twenty-five bob a
week&mdash;she wanted picked women&mdash;it would just have
done me.  Lil Rayburn lent me her little squirrel
coat and a black velvet hat.  I tell you I looked a
treat when I went down!  There were three hundred
and forty girls waiting; we were sent across
the stage thirty at the time.  The great Hayward
sat in the stalls, with her pince-nez up.  'You!'
she said, pointing; 'the one in the squirrel coat!'  So
I went to her.  'I think you'll do,' she drawled;
'you know what the money is?'  'Twenty-five,
Miss Hayward,' I said, 'isn't it?'  'No, a
guinea,' she said, 'it doesn't matter to
<i>you</i>.'  'Thank you,'  I said, 'I've got to keep myself
out of <i>my</i> salary&mdash;<i>I</i> haven't got a man, and a
flat!'  Potter, the agent, was in an awful stew&mdash;'Oh,
you shouldn't have spoken to Miss Hayward
like that!'  'To <i>hell</i>!' I said."
</p>

<p>
"Cat!" cried Rosalind.  "Because you were
well-dressed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and if I had gone shabby, she wouldn't
have noticed me at all....  You know I've been
in the Variety business since you saw me?"
</p>

<p>
"The music-halls!  You haven't?"
</p>

<p>
"Straight!  I was one of the Four Sisters
Tarantelle.  Jolly good money&mdash;I got five
pounds a week when we worked two shows a
night; I never got less than three ten.  I can't get
it on the stage."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you give them up?  But the tips
are very heavy, aren't they?"
</p>

<p>
"They weren't heavy for <i>me</i>, I didn't tip
anybody except the dresser.  Chloe made the
engagements, so Chloe could pay the tips.  Trust
this child!  What does make you sick in that
business is the comedians, with the red noses and the
umbrellas&mdash;they're always after you.  There
was a little brute in one show&mdash;his wife was in
the bill, too; she did sentimental ballads.  Well! how
he could let her travel <i>I</i> don't know.  It <i>was</i>
her last week, but she wasn't fit to be working so
long, we almost expected any night&mdash;&mdash;  And
there he was after me all the time!  'I shall write
to you, Tattie&mdash;I see you go to Balham, and
Walham Green next week!'  'Who gave you
leave to call me "Tattie?"' I said; 'you low cur,
I wish I was a man, to give you a good hiding!'  I
did pity his wife.  She never spoke to me&mdash;she
used to pass me in the wings with her head turned
away; I suppose she thought I was as bad as <i>he</i>
was.  I said to her one evening when she was ill,
'Can I get you anything, Miss&mdash;&mdash;'  I forget
what her name was.  'No, I thank you, Miss
Tarantelle,' she said&mdash;like that; wouldn't look
at me!  I <i>was</i> so sorry for her.  Poor little
woman, what a life!"
</p>

<p>
Rosalind shuddered.  After a pause, she said:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You're well out of it, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Except for the money.  I expect I'll go back
to it as soon as I can.  I had a contract for a
year&mdash;they wanted the option of renewing for another
year."
</p>

<p>
"<i>They</i> were to have the option?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;all on their side; I didn't think it was
good enough to sign that.  So I said I'd like to,
but I was going to be married at the end of the
summer."
</p>

<p>
"You weren't really?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much!  No marriage for me&mdash;not in
the Profession anyhow!&mdash;but lots of them think
a contract doesn't bind you any more if you marry.
Lil Rayburn put me up to that dodge.  She lent
me her song when the Tarantelles wanted me&mdash;it
was a great concession: her big success!  Whenever
she doesn't want to sign an option and is
afraid to refuse point-blank, she looks bashful and
says she's going to be married at the end of the
summer.  She has been going to be married 'at
the end of the summer' for the last nine years!"  They
turned to the fire, and lit cigarettes&mdash;Rosalind's;
she had remembered to put a hundred
in her trunk.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'What is the use of loving a girl<br />

</p>

<p class="noindent">
hummed Tattie.  The song was just published.
"They <i>are</i> fine cigarettes!
</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p>
"My having the best of everything?"
</p>

<p>
"No, your wanting the worst.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'What if she's fair beyond all compare,<br />
  And what if her eyes are blue&mdash;&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Fancy living in your style, and coming to rooms
like these for fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tattie," said Rosalind, "that's just what
I did come for!  I haven't any fun at home."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought in Society they had no end of
a good time?"
</p>

<p>
"So they do, in a way, but it's the wrong way
for me&mdash;I never rehearsed for it, I'm not easy
in the part; I wasn't meant for high-class comedy.
And I miss you&mdash;I've no pal now."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i>'ve missed <i>you</i>, I can tell you!  Oh, the
tour after you left, wasn't that damn dull!  The
girl I lived with was so 'off'&mdash;common.  Well,
you can tell <i>I'm</i> a perfect lady&mdash;I just said
'damn'&mdash;but I usedn't to, did I?  Remember?
Good-hearted girl, but she was so horrid at table.
And under that silk blouse&mdash;all anyhow!  Not
that I like to see a girl with too smart underlinen,
I always think it looks fishy; but hers was&mdash;well,
if she had been run over one day when we were
out, I'd have been ashamed to own her!"
</p>

<p>
"Let's go and look up some of the Company,
shall we?" said Rosalind.  "What name had
I better have?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with 'Heath?'  There
are plenty of 'Miss Heaths' about."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you're sure to let the 'Rosalind'
slip, and that will give me away.  Introduce me as
'Miss Daintree.'  Do you know where any of the
women are staying?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll find them on the pier.  We always
make for the pier on Sunday evenings when there's
a concert; it's something to do.  I suppose I'm
to say you're in the Profession?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm an actress out of an engagement," assented
Rosalind, throwing her cigarette in the
fender.  "Make haste, or we shall be too late!"
</p>

<p>
The boards of <i>Little Miss Kiss-and-Tell</i> were
big outside the pier.  At the turnstile Miss
Lascelles nodded towards them, saying, "In the
Company."  The man answered, "All right, Miss;
come in through the gate, then."  At the pay-box
of the theatre she showed her card, saying, "Can
you oblige me with a couple of seats?"  The
business manager answered, "With pleasure, my
dear."
</p>

<p>
The gas-stoves glowed redly, and the theatre
was much better warmed than the majority of
theatres in London.  They sat down in the third
row of the stalls, and listened to a dispirited
soprano who was supposed to be singing "The
Holy City."  She was not really singing "The
Holy City;" from beginning to end she articulated
not a word save "Jerusalem."  She simply
kept her mouth ajar and wailed the air; but she
was successful.
</p>

<p>
There were only about twenty people in the
crimson velvet seats, and most of these were
<i>Kiss-and-Tell</i> people.  The others were very young
men, in caps, who bore the sacred music on
Sunday evening for the sake of an advance view of the
girls who were to perform on Monday.  The very
young men watched the arrivals with much interest,
and if the ladies in the stalls were unattractive,
it was said in a Blithepoint club on Sunday
night that the piece on the pier to-morrow was no
good.
</p>

<p>
When the dispirited soprano had finished, the
actresses applauded her warmly, in the hope of
cheering her up; and the sixpenny balcony rattled
its umbrellas, in the hope of getting a song more
than it had paid for.  Then one of the actresses
murmured to Miss Lascelles, "How badly she
holds herself, doesn't she?" and Miss Lascelles
presented "Miss Daintree."
</p>

<p>
Rosalind soon discovered that nobody was
sanguine of <i>Little Miss Kiss-and-Tell</i> being well
received, and&mdash;having forgotten something of the
world she was revisiting&mdash;it surprised her to note
the light-heartedness of the professionals, who
tottered on the brink of disaster.  They were all
pitiably poor, they were likely to fall out of
employment at the worst time of year; but they said
gaily, "Oh well, let's hope for the best!  It may
be all right at night.  It's no use looking on the
black side of things."  And most of them were
totally dependent on their salaries, though that
was not the belief of the very young men who
endured "The Holy City."
</p>

<p>
Only Miss Jinman, a large, elderly lady who
spoke in a bass voice, was pessimistic.  Years ago
she had sung in parts of dignity, and hectored
first-rate touring companies; to-day she was engaged
for an amorous old woman in Turkish trousers,
whom the low comedian was to pelt with insults as
often as she came on the stage.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think the piece will last a month," she
said to Rosalind, in her lugubrious bass.  "It
isn't amusing at all.  Vulgar, very vulgar!  I may
be too critical; I'm used to such high-class things,
as you know&mdash;my notices as 'Buttercup' were
immense&mdash;but I call it a 'rotter.'  I see a frost, a
killing frost, my dear!  I keep my opinion to
myself"&mdash;she was disseminating it with gusto&mdash;"I
don't want to give the others the hump, but I see
us all out of a shop till the spring comes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're always croaking, Miss Jinman,"
snapped a black-eyed girl with golden hair.  "Give
us a chance, do!"
</p>

<p>
"A chance?" returned Miss Jinman heavily.
"Chit, you have no chance.  It's only kindness to
tell you so."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for being so kind!" said the girl.
She had not been long on the stage.  Her married
sister kept "Dining Rooms" in Holloway, and
less than a year ago the "artiste" had served as
waitress there and been ordered to "'Urry up with
that there Yorkshire-pudden."
</p>

<p>
"You will never do any better than you're
doing," affirmed Miss Jinman.  "And I could say
as much to others present if I hadn't too much
consideration for their feelings.  To more than
one!" she added significantly.  "Look at <i>me</i>,
with all my experience!  And <i>I</i> am clever, and <i>I</i>
can sing; my notices as 'Buttercup' were
immense.  And where am I now?  On a pier with
amateurs&mdash;amateurs and novices.  I don't know
what the Profession is coming to&mdash;it's a very
different thing to what it was when <i>I</i> was in my
prime!"
</p>

<p>
"I expect most things have woke up a bit since
then," said the golden-haired brunette; "the
bringing in of railways must have made such a
difference."
</p>

<p>
"Small-part people were taught to respect the
principals," said Miss Jinman sternly.  "Minxes
kept their places."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity you couldn't keep yours," said the
dark one with the golden locks.  But harmony was
restored during the next selection by the band.
</p>

<p>
There was a little sleet blowing when the
audience straggled homeward.  The lights of the
Belle Vue Hotel were not put out yet, and
carelessly, Miss Jinman observed that the people
inside must be warmer than <i>she</i> was.  Rosalind took
the hint.  It is only in the lowest ranks of the
theatrical profession that the ladies refresh
themselves in bars; a second-rate provincial actress
would wither the person who invited her; but Miss
Jinman and Miss Lascelles had adapted their
manners to their company, and it was a very
humble Company indeed.  So they went into the
Lounge, and sat down.
</p>

<p>
Another professional lady came in, and inquired
generously, "Are you drinking, girls?"
</p>

<p>
Miss Lascelles said, "Yes, we've got port wine."
</p>

<p>
"Serve you right," said the other lady, with a
pretty wit.
</p>

<p>
Though she was on the high road to Prague,
Lady Darlington was relieved to see that the clock
pointed to five minutes to ten.  When the Lounge
closed, the party shook hands with her heartily,
and hoped they would meet her again in the morning.
Distressingly ill-bred of them to drink port
in a smoky bar&mdash;not at all the sort of thing I
can ask you to condone.  But some of the sirens
who had lolled in velvet fauteuils were financing
on coppers until the first week's treasury was paid,
and tea and bread-and-butter was all they had had
to support their internal economies during the
day.  How amused the very young men in the
stalls would be at my simplicity in believing it!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
Since the last chapter went away to be
typewritten I, myself, have been in the theatre on
Blithepoint Pier.  A pantomime was being
performed.  The seat I was in yielded me a view of
more than I had paid to look at; I could see the
Prompt entrance, which is the place where they
signal for the sunset and the moonbeams and
where the players come to peep at the doings on
the stage.  Last night a young woman came there.
She wore a brief, blue skirt, and a silver crown,
and for the nonce an unlovely wrap hung over her
whitened back and bosom, since you may get
rheumatism in the Prompt entrance, as well as
moonbeams.  Before the footlights two comic men were
bawling a duet; I knew they were comic because
they had made their faces so repulsive; and the
spirit moving her, the woman broke into lazy
dance steps to the refrain.  In the glare, and the
distance she was pretty.  As I watched, I felt
instinctively for the hand of Rosalind; I knew the
craving that was in her blood, and turned to meet
her gaze.  If she had been there, I think she would
have liked me.  I said, "Those who saw that
would understand Rosalind; the tawdry figure
dancing in the draught says everything!"  That
was why I brought the picture at home, to show it
to you ... but somehow, all at once, I doubt
whether you will understand any better than you
did.
</p>

<p>
However I beg you to believe that on the
morrow Rosalind accompanied Tattie Lascelles to a
rehearsal with infinite zest.  She had no right to
accompany her, but a discussion was in progress
when they arrived, and she passed unchallenged.
Mr. Omee, the local manager, who stood in the
pit, was talking to Mr. Quisby, the travelling
manager, who stood on the stage.  It appeared that
owing to the pressure of Christmas traffic, the
railway company had failed to dispatch the
scenery.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but who has been to the station?  What
do they say?"
</p>

<p>
"I tell you the fools at this end don't know
anything about it."
</p>

<p>
"What the bleak Helvellyn's the good of
bringing the piece without any scenery?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't there any scenery in your theatre?"
</p>

<p>
"I've told you what cloth you can have, my
boy.  That's the best we can do."
</p>

<p>
"It's no use offering us Hyde Park Corner
when we want a blooming mosque! ... Well,
let's have a look at it!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Omee shouted for "Bates."
</p>

<p>
There was a lull, and then from unseen heights
a voice announced that Bates had just "stepped
outside."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Omee ramped in the pit.
</p>

<p>
The shouts for "Bates" were resumed&mdash;the
rafters rang with the name of "Bates"&mdash;and
after some minutes a discomfited working man
slouched onto the stage, to be received with a
volley of abuse.  He was understood to retort that
he was unable to be in two places at once, and
parties who expected it might find someone else
to do the work, that was the straight tip.  Those
nearest to him also learnt that he had a poor
opinion of the job at its blessed best.
</p>

<p>
"Let's have that Hyde Park cloth," commanded
Mr. Omee.  "Come on, look alive, man&mdash;hurry up!"
</p>

<p>
"What <i>I</i> want to know," grunted the low
comedian, "is 'ow I'm to get that wheeze of
mine into that song.  That's what's bothering
me."
</p>

<p>
"What song?" inquired Miss Lascelles.
</p>

<p>
"What song!  Why, 'All the Winners.'  I was
going to say the Blithepoint football team was 'all
the winners' in the match on Saturday, and now
I'm told that Sweetbay beat 'em.  My luck again!
That queers my wheeze."
</p>

<p>
"Why not say," suggested Rosalind, "that the
<i>next time</i> Sweetbay is rash enough to play them,
Blithepoint will be all the winners?"
</p>

<p>
"Wot ho!" said the low comedian, brightening.
He added promptly, "Of course that's what
I was thinking of doing!  But I must see if I can
get all that cackle into the tune.  Where's the
conductor of the blooming band?"
</p>

<p>
Presently the cloth was displayed.  It was no
faithful representation of Hyde Park Corner, but
it was still less like a mosque, and the players stood
about, and sneered, and muttered contemptuous
criticisms.  Miss Jinman said that in all her
experience she had never known such disgraceful
mismanagement before.  She was to figure in her
Turkish trousers in this scene, and she pointed
morosely to the omnibuses painted outside the
hospital.
</p>

<p>
"Clear the stage, please!" cried Mr. Quisby.
"We'll just run through Miss Vavasour's scenes.
Come on, Miss Vavasour&mdash;we don't want to be
here all day!"  He told her this indignantly, as
if the delay in lowering the cloth were directly
attributable to her.  She was the girl who had been
suddenly promoted to the leading part.
</p>

<p>
The manager of the theatre lounged from the
pit into the stalls, where Rosalind sat now too.
He chewed his cigar, and there was gloom on his
face.  This should have been a week of large
receipts, but the outlook was unpromising.
</p>

<p>
Miss Vavasour was rendered additionally nervous
by the fact that she had not had time to learn
the lines.  She advanced constrainedly, and said
in a timid voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'We are alone at last!  Oh rapture!'"
</p>

<p>
"Speak up, my dear!" said Mr. Quisby.  "Say
it as if you meant it.  'Rapture!'  Do a bit of a
caper there, be <i>fetching</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"'We are alone at last!'" repeated Miss
Vavasour, with a mechanical jump.  "'Oh rapture!'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh rats!" said the manager of the theatre.
He turned to Rosalind&mdash;"Can she sing?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"She sings even better than she acts," said
Rosalind innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" groaned the manager.  "Well,
what are they waiting for now?"
</p>

<p>
It was the cue for an embrace, and Miss
Vavasour was hanging forward to be clasped in the
Tenor's arms, but the Tenor had a request to
make&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Quisby," he said, disregarding her, "I
think it would be better if somebody read my part.
I don't know how I shall get through to-night as
it is&mdash;my cold is so severe."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my sufferings!" muttered the manager
of the theatre.  "Now the Tenor's got a
cold.  This is going to be a great draw, this
show is!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think you could just 'walk
through' the 'business,' my boy?" Mr. Quisby
asked.  "The girl's a bit uneasy in the love
scenes&mdash;she'll be all over the shop to-night if she don't
know what you're going to do."
</p>

<p>
"I am really very ill," insisted the Tenor
feebly; "I'm not fit to rehearse, I ought to be
in bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right then," answered Mr. Quisby.
He beckoned to the prompter.  "Here, read the
lines&mdash;give Miss Vavasour her cues.  Do get on,
Miss Vavasour, we shall be in the theatre till
Doomsday if you don't wake up!  'We are alone
at last'&mdash;go back, please."
</p>

<p>
"'We are alone at last.  Oh rapture!'" faltered
Miss Vavasour for the third time, with the
mechanical jump.
</p>

<p>
"That's marked 'Kiss,'" said the prompter.
He was a slovenly man with a dirty face.
</p>

<p>
"I know it is," snapped Miss Vavasour.  "Do
let's get to the next line!"
</p>

<p>
"I was 'elping yer," said the prompter,
aggrieved.  "If yer don't want no 'elp, sye
so!"  He read, "'My Prize!  My Pearlikins!'"
</p>

<p>
"'Sometimes,'" continued Miss Vavasour,
simulating maiden modesty.  "'I wonder if it's all
a dream.  <i>Why</i> do you love me?  You might have
married Delicia, who has millions&mdash;<i>I</i> am a very
poor girl.'"
</p>

<p>
"You're a very poor actress too," said Mr. Omee
under his breath.
</p>

<p>
"'Why do I love yer, sweetheart?'" mumbled
the prompter.  "'Your question reminds me of
what the apple-blossom said to the moon.'"
</p>

<p>
"Band cue!" shouted Mr. Quisby.  "Have
you got that, there in the orchestra?&mdash;'The
Apple-blossom and the Moon,' song!  Go on,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Song over.  Get on with the
lines."
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me!" exclaimed the Tenor, reappearing.
"That's a cue for the limelight.  I don't
think it has been marked; I didn't get it at the
dress rehearsal."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, it is marked," declared the prompter;
"<i>I</i> marked it."  He referred resentfully to the
typescript.  "'Moonlight'!  There it is, in its
proper plice."
</p>

<p>
"Its proper place is <i>on me</i>," said the Tenor.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll see it's all right to-night," said
Mr. Quisby, with impatience.  "If you're so ill,
you had better get home and rest your voice,
hadn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I should be only too glad to be at home," rejoined
the Tenor stiffly.  "I just called attention
to the matter for the sake of the scene....
Interests of the Show at heart!"
</p>

<p>
"Where do I speak from now, Mr. Quisby?"
murmured Miss Vavasour.
</p>

<p>
"You're on the balcony, my dear&mdash;up left.
'And now ta-ta, my Romeo'!  Get on with it,
get on!"
</p>

<p>
"One moment, Miss Vavasour!" put in the
Tenor, coming back.  "You mustn't speak too
soon, there; I expect an encore!  Take your cue
from me."
</p>

<p>
She nodded helplessly.  "'And now ta-ta, my
Romeo.'"
</p>

<p>
"''T is not the nightingale, let's have a
lark!'" read the prompter.  "'Come out to
supper!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'For thou art as glorious to this night, being
o'er my 'ead&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Come to cues!" said Mr. Quisby, stamping.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'When 'e bestrides the liezy-piecing clouds,<br />
  And siles upon the bosom of the air,'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
gabbled the prompter.
</p>

<p>
"'Bosom of the air'!" bellowed Mr. Quisby.
"Pick up your cues, Miss Vavasour, for Gawd's
sake!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon, I didn't hear it,
Mr. Quisby," she stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, listen, my girl!  What do you
suppose we're here for?  'Bosom of the air'&mdash;caper
down centre.  Lightly&mdash;<i>lightly</i>!  Great
Scot! not like that.  You come down like a sack
o' coals."
</p>

<p>
"The girl has no experience," remarked Miss
Jinman in a deep undertone to all about her.
</p>

<p>
"Go back," shouted Mr. Quisby.  "'Bosom of
the air,' now again!  What have you to say as you
run down?"
</p>

<p>
"I forget," she whimpered.
</p>

<p>
"What's the line, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;you?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm just looking to see," said the
prompter.
</p>

<p>
"Looking to see?" yelled Mr. Quisby, furiously,
throwing up his arms.  "Upon my life and
soul it's maddening!  What's your business, what
are you engaged as, what is it you're supposed
to be?  <i>Are</i> you the prompter, or are you not?
Good &mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is it asking too much of a man
with the book in his hand to follow the lines?
I've got the whole weight of the production on
me, I've done the work of twenty men, I'm
wearing myself out&mdash;and nobody takes the trouble to
study a part, or to read the 'scrip!  Ladies and
gentlemen, the ensanguined rehearsal is dismissed,
while the prompter looks for the line!"
</p>

<p>
"'Supper?  Oh, it will be a merry evening!'
read the prompter, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Very well then!  Now, Miss Vavasour! let's
have it."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's v-v-very hard on me," said Miss
Vavasour, beginning to cry; "I've only had the
p-part three days."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, do your best!  You've nothing
to cry about, I've been very patient with you.
'Supper?  Oh, it <i>will</i> be a merry evening!'  Trip
down <i>pretty</i>; speak as you come."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Very</i> hard on me," she sobbed; "I think it's
m-m-most unfeeling!"
</p>

<p>
"Bring me a chair!" called Mr. Quisby to no
one in particular.  "Look here, my girl, I'm
going to see you do it if we have to stop on the
stage till the doors open.  Understand?  If I
keep you here till the curtain rises, I'll see you
do it!  'Bosom of the air!'  Now take it up sharp."
</p>

<p>
"A bit of <i>all</i> right, keeping the Company 'ere
to see a novice taught her business, I <i>don't</i> think,"
grumbled the low comedian.
</p>

<p>
Miss Vavasour, still sobbing, drooped to where
the balcony was to be imagined.  She sniffed
violently, and, with an effort at sprightly grace,
scuttled down the stage again.
</p>

<p>
"'Supper?  Oh, it <i>will</i> be a merry evening!'
she quavered.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be a merry evening to-morrow&mdash;about
sixpence in the house!" growled the manager of
the theatre.  He caught Rosalind's eye.  "Are
the rest of you as good as this, my dear?" he said
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," said cheerful Rosalind, "I think
you'll like us all!"
</p>

<p>
Presently Miss Lascelles wanted to see where
she was to dress, and with a heartful of memories
Rosalind explored with her.  The pencilled lists
of names on most of the doors were lengthy, but
Miss Lascelles was to share a room with no one
but Miss Vavasour this week, so she was jubilant,
and had been in no hurry to annex a gas-burner.
As a rule the ladies scamper on Monday morning
to secure the best places.
</p>

<p>
The room was very comfortably furnished.
</p>

<p>
"Oh my!" said Miss Lascelles, enraptured.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear!" said Lady Darlington, disappointed.
"Why, there's a full length mirror!
Where's the single washstand for five people?
Where's the one chair, broken?  Why, you've
got two rugs!  This is a blow, Tattie!"
</p>

<p>
Miss Lascelles was doing coon steps before the
mirror.  "Is the rehearsal hateful enough for you?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a dream of delight," said Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
But even she was rather tired of it when it
finished at five o'clock.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half-past five when they reached
their lodging, and they were glad to hear from
Mrs. Cheney that "the kittle was on the bile."  At
a quarter to seven Miss Lascelles had to hurry
to the theatre again.
</p>

<p>
Rosalind went later.  The wind had risen, and
on the pier she had to fight against it.  The lamps
streaked a heaving sea.  The little wooden theatre
was fairly full, and a few Christmas trippers in
the balcony were comporting themselves with less
decorum than prevails in Blithepoint as a rule.
Knowing what she knew of affairs behind the
curtain, Rosalind heard the whistles with misgiving.
She feared that if the whistlers found the
entertainment meagre, they were likely to create
entertainment for themselves.
</p>

<p>
However, they listened to the opening chorus
with polite attention.  It was surprising how
attractive many of the chorus ladies had become.
They represented the seamen of the Battleship
<i>Deadly Oyster</i>, and wore sailors' jackets and
trousers made of silk&mdash;or a material that
passed for it.  Some of the seamen also wore
paste necklaces.  They sang that there was
"No life so jolly as Jack's," and when one
watched their saucy gambols, and remembered
that they were actually paid to be there, it looked
as if there could be no life so jolly as a chorus
girl's.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, the first to provoke dissatisfaction
was the Tenor.  He had been refused permission
to beg indulgence for his cold, but resolving
that the Audience should understand that they
were not hearing him to advantage, he kept laying
his hand on his chest, with an air of suffering.  It
made him a depressing figure; and when he
exclaimed, "'Beware, my temper's hot!'" a
humourist in the balcony cried, "How's your
poultice?"
</p>

<p>
A man in the pit said "Hush!" but several
persons giggled, and the humourist was stimulated
to further witticisms.  Other humourists began to
envy him his successes; as the piece proceeded,
the interruptions were frequent.  Once the low
comedian attempted a repartee, but it came too
late in the evening to turn the scale; the
malcontents had grown spiteful, and as a rejoinder he
was hissed.  His companions stared at one
another haggardly.  "Behind," they stood quaking,
dreading the cues that would recall them to the
stage.
</p>

<p>
At every exit they came off gasping, "The
brutes! the pigs!  Oh, what a <i>wicked</i> house it is!"
</p>

<p>
The "house" would have been astonished at
the emotion displayed, at the "extraordinary
sensitiveness of such people."  To the Stalls there
were "Just a few noisy young fellows upstairs
who made jokes."  Indeed it seemed a long time
between the jokes to the Stalls; they wore an air of
superior detachment, but they were secretly amused.
Only Rosalind understood.  Rosalind felt faint.
</p>

<p>
Miss Lascelles had been accepted by the
Balcony while they were still good humoured, and she
was among those who escaped contumely; but Miss
Jinman's record availed her little.  Derisive cheers
greeted her every entrance, and a lifetime on the
boards could not save her from the sickness of
the senses which attacks a player who is being
"guyed."  As for Miss Vavasour, she trembled
as if she had ague when a youth mimicked her
high notes in her solo, and on her bloodless face,
while she sang, the make-up stood out in patches,
like paint on the cheeks of a corpse.  At the
conclusion of the song she clung hysterically to Tattie
Lascelles in the wings.
</p>

<p>
When the end was reached, the Audience rose
murmuring that it was a "silly piece," and "not
worth going to"&mdash;they "shouldn't think it
would be a success!"  No one but Rosalind
suspected the despair that was hidden by the curtain.
</p>

<p>
She made her way to the stage-door.  Tedious
as the performance had been, a number of young
men had preceded her, and were assembling to
address the chorus ladies when they came out.
(Thirty were waiting there that night when the
Chorus came out at last.)  An old woman&mdash;a
dresser&mdash;was hurrying in with two glasses
containing whisky from the refreshment room.  One
of the young men asked her jauntily if she would
take a message for him to "the sixth girl on
the right."  She said she was in a hurry, and
pushed the door open.  As the door-keeper wasn't
there, to be obstructive, Rosalind followed her
inside.
</p>

<p>
Many of the players were in the flaring passage.
They had not begun to doff their costumes yet;
they were lingering in groups, a tinselled,
nerveless crowd with harassed eyes.  Miss Vavasour
sat crying on a clothes hamper; Miss Jinman was
waiting weakly for her whisky.  As it appeared,
her gaze fell on the huddled girl; "Here, have
half of this, child!" she said gently.  The
brunette with golden hair exclaimed, "No, no, take
yours, Miss Jinman; Queenie can have half of
mine!"  Everybody kept casting anxious glances
in the direction of the stage, where voices could be
heard disputing.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Tat!" murmured Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
Now Miss Lascelles, as we know, had had less
than the majority to unhinge her, but so infectious
was the atmosphere, so easily swayed are some of
these "extraordinarily sensitive" people of the
theatre, that as Rosalind's arm was slipped round
her waist, she immediately burst into tears, and
sobbed as if her heart would break.
</p>

<p>
"Cheer up," said Rosalind.  "It'll go all right
after a few more rehearsals."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be b-better directly," gulped Miss
Lascelles.  "D-don't mind me.  I'm a fool, but
I can't help it; I'm broke up!"
</p>

<p>
"We're all of us broke up," groaned Miss
Jinman.  "Did you ever see such a house as it
was?  In all my experience I never saw anything
like it!  What were they saying as they came out?
Do you think we shall go on, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> sha'n't be kept, anyhow," wailed Miss
Vavasour.  "Mr. Quisby's been bullying me as if it
was all my fault.  I shall be out of a shop again!
And I did hope I was settled till the spring&mdash;I
don't know what I shall do, I'm sure!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" inquired Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
"That's him, quarrelling with Mr. Omee
there," said Miss Lascelles.  "Mr. Omee says
he won't let the piece go on to-morrow night."
</p>

<p>
"Not go on?"
</p>

<p>
"They say he says so," put in the demi-blonde.
"That's all gas&mdash;he'd have to shut the theatre;
he won't do that."
</p>

<p>
"If you ask <i>me</i>," said the low comedian, taking
part in the conference gloomily, "it puts the
kybosh on the tour.  We may as well pack up our
props, and git.  There's no good health for <i>Miss
Kiss-and-Tell</i> after to-night's show."
</p>

<p>
"Git?" demanded Miss Jinman, "Git where?
I shall have my rights; I've got a contract."
</p>

<p>
"Take it to your Uncle's!" said the low comedian.
"See what he'll lend you on it.  If you
ask me, the Syndicate's a wrong 'un.  If we strike
it lucky, we'll get our fares; and if we don't
strike it lucky, we can travel on our luggage.  I see
it sticking out a foot!"
</p>

<p>
A shudder ran through the players.  They gathered
about him dumbly.
</p>

<p>
"We can all claim a fortnight's salary in lieu
of notice," asserted Miss Jinman, rallying.
"That's the Law.  It's the Rule of the
Profession."
</p>

<p>
The company perked up a little.  They turned
their eyes to Miss Jinman.
</p>

<p>
"So I've been led to believe," said the low
comedian.  "And in such circs the pros always
get it, I <i>don't</i> think!  Claim?  Oh, we can claim!
We'll all get fat claiming, won't we?  You're
better off to claim from the Post Office than from
a Syndicate&mdash;at all events you do know where
St. Martin's le Grand <i>is</i>."
</p>

<p>
The company collapsed.
</p>

<p>
"The long and the short of it," he continued,
"is that we're out with a stumour of a piece.
<i>Why</i> didn't it go?  Is there anything wrong with
<i>us</i>?  No! a jolly clever crowd, if you ask <i>me</i>.
The piece has got no stamina&mdash;" "stamina" was
not the word he used&mdash;"that's what's the
matter; and that 'Iyde Park Corner cloth settled us.
I'll lay anyone 'ere ten to one that the tour dries
up, and the Syndicate does a guy.  'Oo's Quisby?"
</p>

<p>
"Quisby?" they gasped.  "'Who's Quisby?'"
</p>

<p>
"Quisby!" repeated the low comedian
emphatically; "I say, 'Oo's Quisby?  I'll lay
anybody 'ere ten to one that Quisby calls us to-morrow
to say he ain't responsible.  Now?  I wish all
Syndicates were in 'ell."
</p>

<p>
The dispute between the powers had ended,
and suddenly the prompter's voice rang through
the passage.  He bawled, "Everybody on the
stige, please!  Principals and Chorus are wanted
on the stige!"
</p>

<p>
The eyes met for a moment, and then the players
trooped away, with sinking hearts.  The cold,
bare stage was in shadow, for the floats and
battens had been extinguished, and the only light
was shed by a single burner of the T-piece.  By
the T-piece Mr. Quisby stood, his back to the
dark emptiness of the auditorium.  The prompter
was still heard calling in the distance;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Everybody on the stige, please!  Principals
and Chorus on the stige!"
</p>

<p>
Shivering, they flocked there, some in their
plumes and spangles, others already in their
shabby street clothes; many were in a state of
transition&mdash;the faces daubed with grease, the
undergarments and naked necks revealed by hasty
ulsters.  Nobody spoke.  When the last comer
had scrambled to the crowd, all looked at
Mr. Quisby.  The suspense that held them mute was
pitiable.
</p>

<p>
Outside, the thirty young men had collected to
accost the merry chorus girls.
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen," said Mr. Quisby,
"there will be no performance to-morrow."  He
forced a hearty air.  "I'm going to talk to you
like a pal.  Things look a bit rocky, but we must
hope for the best.  I won't disguise from you that
there may be no tour.  Now you all know as much
as <i>I</i> do&mdash;there <i>may</i> be no tour.  Whether there
is, or not, I've no doubt we shall all get what's
due to us.  I hope we shall, I'm sure&mdash;God
knows <i>I</i> can't afford to lose what they owe me!"  He
made a slight pause, to let this sink.  "As
soon as I hear from London what the Management
intends to do, we'll put our heads together
again.  You worked nobly to-night, nobly&mdash;one
and all!  Some of you ought to be in London,
getting your thirty, and forty, quid a week!  If the
thing's a frost, it won't be the fault of the artists,
and I mean to let the Management know it!"
</p>

<p>
"What Management?" cried the low comedian.
"'Ave <i>you</i> left off being manager all of a
sudden?"
</p>

<p>
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you're all aware,
the Management is a Syndicate," Mr. Quisby
proceeded with difficulty.  "If this was <i>my</i> crowd, I
should talk very different.  Do you know what I
should say if this was my crowd?  I should say,
'Between you and I, I'm a bit doubtful of the
piece&mdash;that's straight!&mdash;but I've got a first-class
company of artists, and by George I mean to
keep 'em!'  I should say, 'If I can't pull this
piece together, then I'll cast the whole blessed
crowd for another!'  That's what I should say
if <i>I</i> was manager.  But I'm not.  No, I'm one of
you.  We're all in the same boat.  I'm engaged
at a salary, like yourselves.  Still"&mdash;he smeared
the perspiration round his lying lips&mdash;"still it's
always darkest before dawn.  There's a silver
lining to every cloud, and we may find as good fish
in the sea as ever came out of it.  Mr. Omee won't
have the piece, and&mdash;er&mdash;you're all to clear
your props out of the theatre first thing in the
morning; but there are plenty of other theatres
in the kingdom!  We must stick together.  Where
there's a will, there's a way!  We must stick
together, like Englishmen in the hour of trouble
all the world over, and&mdash;er, er&mdash;be loyal to
the show!  Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;Boys and
girls!&mdash;Mr. Omee is waiting to see me in his
office.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he couldn't have spoken any fairer,"
many of the poor, wretched women said to one
another as they lagged through the forsaken
streets.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
Indeed it was Mr. Omee whom the Company
censured&mdash;Mr. Omee who had been inhuman
enough to banish a worthless performance from his
theatre.  "Never," said Miss Jinman, "in all her
experience had she known artists to be so grossly
insulted."  Mr. Quisby's position might be
ambiguous, Mr. Quisby might be shirking his
responsibilities; not to put too fine a point upon it,
Mr. Quisby might be a rogue.  But he had paid
them compliments&mdash;and Mr. Omee had shut his
doors against them.  Mr. Omee was the innocent
person whom they execrated and reviled.
</p>

<p>
In the quarter where the "professional
apartments" of Blithepoint are most numerous, the
landladies looked anxious in the morning.  On
every doorstep in Corporation Road, and half way
down Alfreton Terrace, the news was known by
nine o'clock.  The lodgers were obliged to fence
with searching questions at breakfast, and many of
the houris heating curling-tongs in the parlour-fire
were told that it would "save trouble if they got
in their dinner themselves."
</p>

<p>
Towards midday the Company straggled off the
pier with baskets and parcels, and the baggageman
was busy collecting the clothes-hampers.  The
boards of <i>Little Miss Kiss-and-Tell</i> had gone
from the turnstiles, and later, bill-stickers came
along and splashed up advertisements of a
stopgap.  The rejected comedians stood on the Parade
and eyed the work morosely.  They had hoped
the theatre would have to be closed.  Miss Jinman
said, "It was very strange, to say the least; she
didn't understand how the bills had been printed
since last night!  It looked to <i>her</i> as if Mr. Omee
had been <i>playing them false from the start</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Then striking proof of Mr. Omee's perfidy was
forthcoming, his brutal nature was revealed to the
full&mdash;he offered to make the stranded performers
by whom he had lost money, a present of their
fares if they liked to return to their homes.
"Ah," said the Chorus, "<i>that</i> shows what a dirty
trick he served us!"  "He has exposed his hand
<i>there</i>," said Miss Jinman; "<i>wants to get us out
of the town</i>!"
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Quisby, who meant to pay them nothing,
but was endeavouring to make use of them in
Slocombe-on-the-Swamp the following week before
he decamped, told them there was a reviving
prospect of a three months' tour.
</p>

<p>
So not more than a third of the Company
profited by Mr. Omee's generosity, and the others
warned them that they were being very unwise.
</p>

<p>
And by this time the tidings of the disaster had
spread from Corporation Road and Alfreton Terrace
as far as the Grand Hotel, where it provided
languid amusement, and the plight of the players
was known to all the visitors on the Front.
Including Conrad.
</p>

<p>
But it was not until Friday, December 26th,
that one of those incidents which may occur to
anybody associated him with the matter.
</p>

<p>
It had been misty since morning, and towards
the close of day the fog deepened.  When he left
a house where he had been lunching with a man,
he took the wrong turning.  So far as he was able
to see at all, he saw that he had blundered into a
neighbourhood which was strange to him.  A
humble neighbourhood, apparently, with nothing
of a watering-place about it.  This being Boxing-day,
the little shops to which he came were shuttered,
and owing to the weather, few people were
abroad.  He wandered amid dim desertion.
Then as he paused, hesitating, two girls emerged
suddenly from the fog, and stopped before him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" exclaimed one of them, "could you tell
us where Gandy's the greengrocer's is?"
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry," said Conrad, "I can't.  Can
you direct me to the Parade?"
</p>

<p>
She answered absurdly that he was "coming
away from it," though he was standing still.
"It's over there," she said; "you go down there,
and take the first on the left, and keep straight
on.  You can't miss it."
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> missed it," demurred Conrad.
"Thank you for rescuing me.  I wish I could
direct you to Gandy's the greengrocer's in return."
</p>

<p>
The other girl had not spoken yet, but now she
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never mind, thanks, we shall find it; they
say it's quite near.  But it's too dark to make
out the names."
</p>

<p>
It was also too dark to make out her features,
but her voice was delicious, and if the fog didn't
flatter her, she was dowered with the eyes that he
most ardently admired.  He was all at once
sensible of a keen interest in the whereabouts of the
greengrocer's.
</p>

<p>
"That seems to be a shop at the corner; I'll
go over and see what it is!" he said promptly.
But it was a general dealer's, and he came back
not displeased.
</p>

<p>
"Bother!  We <i>must</i> find it!" cried the first girl.
</p>

<p>
"May I come and help you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can come if you like," she said; and
added as a pure concession to formality, "It's
awf'ly kind of you."
</p>

<p>
So they all proceeded through the fog.
</p>

<p>
"It's such a nuisance everything being shut
to-day," the first girl went on.  "That's why we
want Gandy's&mdash;they say Gandy's live there, and
might oblige us.  We can ring 'em up."
</p>

<p>
"Fruit?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said; "flowers&mdash;violets.  We
want some for the concert to-night.  Are you
going?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I am," said Conrad.  "What
concert?  I haven't heard about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, it was only settled this morning.
We're giving a concert at the Victoria Hall&mdash;<i>The
Little Miss Kiss-and-Tell</i> Company.  It's to
help us all.  Mr. Quisby&mdash;our manager&mdash;only
let me know just now.  I'm going to sing a
'flower-song,' and I want some 'button-holes' to
throw among the Audience; I can't do the song
without."
</p>

<p>
"Throw one to me," said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"I will," she promised.  "We ought to get
some people in, as it's bank holiday, don't you
think so?  And if the show 'goes,' we can have
the hall again to-morrow.  The tickets are only
sixpence and a shilling.  Did you see us on the
pier?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "I wasn't here then&mdash;I was
just too late.  How many tickets can you let me
have?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll get them at the door! we haven't
got any.  You'll really come, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll come if I miss my dinner to get there,"
he vowed.  "Where <i>is</i> Victoria Hall?"
</p>

<p>
"It's&mdash;I don't know the name of the street.
It's near the station.  Anybody'll tell you.  We
begin at eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
This was all very well, but the Girl of the Voice
had not spoken again, and he wished she would
say something.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I hear you sing, too?" he asked, looking
across at her.  He looked across at her just
as they approached a lamp-post, and his most
sanguine hopes were realised.  He found her
adorable.
</p>

<p>
"No, <i>I</i> am not in the programme," said
Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a policeman!" cried Miss Lascelles.
"Can you tell us where Gandy's the greengrocer's
is?" she begged again.
</p>

<p>
The constable did not know, and, official though
useless, took a long time to say so.  More
intelligently he remarked that it was "Nasty weather
for Boxing-day," and Conrad gave him a
half-crown.  The next instant they deciphered the
name of "Gandy" themselves.
</p>

<p>
"What a stupid policeman!" exclaimed Rosalind,
pouting.  She pulled the bell, and glanced at
Conrad.  Conrad happened to be glancing at her.
"Your troubles are nearly over," she said with a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"I am not impatient," owned Conrad.
</p>

<p>
There were descending footsteps, and a woman
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
He said ingratiatingly, "I am sorry to disturb
you, but we're trying to get some flowers.  Can
you let me have some?"
</p>

<p>
"Flowers?" said the woman.  She had a vacant stare.
</p>

<p>
"A few bunches of violets," Rosalind explained.
</p>

<p>
"Y-e-s," murmured the woman.  She made a
long pause.  "We 'aven't got no flowers now,"
she said.  "N&mdash;no.  I'm sorry we can't oblige
you."
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell us where we can get some?" put
in Miss Lascelles sharply.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;&mdash;no, I couldn't say, I'm sure,"
faltered the woman....  "There's Peters'
opperzite&mdash;p'raps <i>they</i> might be able to oblige you."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where there's a florist's?"
questioned Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"Florist's?"  She shook her head.  "N&mdash;no,
I can't say as I do&mdash;not one as is likely to be
open to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Let's try Peters'!" they said; and scurried
across the road.
</p>

<p>
Here they pulled without effect; the bell yielded
to them immoderately, but no tinkle came.  They
regarded one another, discouraged.
</p>

<p>
"You had better leave us to our fate," sighed
Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
"Are you dismissing me?"  His tone was
reproachful.
</p>

<p>
"Releasing you," she said, in her best
St. James' manner.
</p>

<p>
"My chains are flowers," said he ornately.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd give 'em to me!" said Tattie
Lascelles.
</p>

<p>
"You shall have them before we part.  Ladies,
I have an inspiration!  You know the way to the
Parade&mdash;let's go down there and get a fly.
Then we've nothing more to do&mdash;the responsibility's
the flyman's.  We'll take him by the hour,
and make him drive us about Blithepoint till we
find a florist's.  Is it carried?"
</p>

<p>
"Unanimously!" cried Rosalind.  "Right
about face, quick march!"
</p>

<p>
And there was a belated fly dozing by the pier.
When the man had recovered from his astonishment
at being hailed, he grew quite brisk, and developed
ideas.  He suggested "Mitchell's," and
drove them to a fashionable florist's in the Mall.
Nothing could have been happier.  Mr. Mitchell
accepted their apologies, and lit the gas as
amiably as if bank-holidays were of no importance.
Bountifully he brought forward his best for them,
and his best was as beauteous as it was expensive.
</p>

<p>
The warm, perfumed air was agreeable after
the fog, and Rosalind among the azaleas was
divine.  (There are few keener pleasures than
taking out a nice woman, and spending money on
her; and it is unnecessary that one should go out
fond of the woman&mdash;it's so easy to get fond of
her in the process.)  "Oh no, really!" she
protested&mdash;and she meant it, for Miss Lascelles was
already laden&mdash;"No, none for me, really!"
</p>

<p>
"Just these," pleaded Conrad; "they're so
pretty&mdash;it's a shame to leave them behind."  He
put them in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like you to see some roses I've got here,
sir," said the proprietor; "it's not often you can
see roses like those."
</p>

<p>
"Exquisite," assented Conrad....  "And just
a few roses, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well one, then," she said succumbing.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have some roses!" commanded Conrad
magnificently.  "And those look nice&mdash;those
lilies-of-the-valley.  You might give us some
lilies-of-the-valley, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll have nothing else," she told him in her
first undertone.  The woman's first undertone is
so sweet.
</p>

<p>
"A few?" he entreated.  "You <i>ought</i> to wear
lilies-of-the-valley!  I wish you were going to sing
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall see you there, sha'n't I?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Yes, I shall be in 'front.'"
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad I met you!"
</p>

<p>
He thought of taking them in to the hotel to tea,
but her companion's toilette had been very hasty.
</p>

<p>
The fly was as fragrant as a flower show when
they drove away.  She buried her fair face in the
blossoms he had given to her.  It's permissible,
but it may stir the man's imagination.  It stirred
Conrad's; he had rarely wanted a kiss from a
woman so much.  In the scented dusk, as their
gaze met, her eyes were luminous&mdash;like stars.
</p>

<p>
The fly rattled into Corporation Road, and he
wondered whether she was going to ask him if he
would 'come in.'  The fly stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Au revoir," he said.  "Victoria Hall?  I
have the name right?"
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come and help us put the flowers
in water?" she suggested.
</p>

<p>
It was of interest to see her without a hat.
When she took off her coat he was captivated.
He stayed about ten minutes, and the other girl
didn't go out of the room.  Both went to the door
with him when he left.
</p>

<p>
"Eight o'clock, then?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Whom shall I ask for if I don't see you?"
</p>

<p>
"'Miss Daintree;' but you're sure to see me."
</p>

<p>
"You won't be late?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I shall be there when it begins.  Good-bye&mdash;and
thanks!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!&mdash;Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He saw her smile to him again from the
step&mdash;and the cab turned.
</p>

<p>
"What a lark!  I say, isn't he mashed on you!
Do you like his moustache?  Hasn't he got lovely
teeth?" exclaimed Tattie in the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Y-e-s....  He's rather nice," said Rosalind.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
Eight o'clock had just struck when Conrad
arrived at the slum where he was to spend the
evening.  The exterior of the hall had no sanguine air.
Four opaque gas globes glimmered over a narrow
entrance, and, in the obscurity, a written appeal
affixed by wafers was barely legible.  He made it
out to be:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Help the Poor <i>Kiss-and-Tell Girls</i>.<br />
  Stranded in the Town through No Fault of their Own.<br />
  Show your Sympathy by Patronising us."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Behind a portière a disreputable-looking man,
wearing a queer overcoat, sat at a small table with
tickets.  He asked, "Sixpence, or a shilling?" and
Conrad said, "A shilling," and the man said,
"Front row."
</p>

<p>
There was a piano on a shallow platform.  In
lieu of footlights, some pots of ferns had been
disposed at wide intervals.  There was no curtain,
but a screen, behind which giggles were audible,
turned a corner of the hall into the most limited of
artists' rooms.  Those artists who were not making
their toilettes, sat quietly among the audience.
Perhaps two hundred chairs were ranged across
the hall, and about fifty of them were occupied.
One of them was occupied by Rosalind.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening," said Conrad.  "May I sit down?"
</p>

<p>
"These are the shilling ones," said she.  "Oh,
of course, if you <i>have</i>!  I'm afraid we're leading
you into awful extravagance? ... It isn't very
full?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm sorry.  I wish I could have sent
some people.  Have you got another concert
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"They're talking about it&mdash;they've got the
hall very cheap."
</p>

<p>
"I might take some tickets, and see what I can
do with them.  I suppose that would be a good
plan, wouldn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said Rosalind, doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Why 'perhaps?'  I thought it was to help
you all?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered.  "Oh, it's meant to."
</p>

<p>
"There's a reservation in your manner," he
said, "that&mdash;  What's the use of our being such
old friends if you don't confide in me?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I didn't think of that," she laughed.
"Well, did you see the man with a coat?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw him with aversion."
</p>

<p>
"I thought it would please you!  That's the
manager, Mr. Quisby."
</p>

<p>
"Your manager, do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm telling you&mdash;the manager of the Company
that came to grief.  The girls are supposed
to have got this up for themselves; but you may
have noticed that you paid your shilling to
Mr. Quisby."
</p>

<p>
"A&mdash;ah!" said Conrad.  "There seems a
weak spot in the business arrangements.  Well,
what do you propose?"
</p>

<p>
A youth in a very shabby tweed suit came on to
the platform.  He sat down at the piano, and rattled
the introduction to the well-known music hall
song entitled <i>My Little Baby Boy</i>.  On bounced
the golden-haired brunette.  She wore a skirt to
the knees, and had made up her face as if for the
glare of a theatre.  Her appearance lowered the
concert to the level of a penny gaff.  Several
women of the shop-keeping class, hitherto
sympathetic, murmured "Oh!" and tightened their
mouths.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't the costume a mistake?" whispered
Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?  How would you have
dressed her?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Conrad, "a long frock."
</p>

<p>
"Mm.  What sort of frock?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should have made her look quiet, and
very&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Respectable.  I know! ... Go on."
</p>

<p>
"I should have said, 'Be pale, and pathetic!'
</p>

<p>
"That's right, I wanted them to; but they've
all got themselves up wrong, except my friend
Miss Lascelles.  Sh!"
</p>

<p>
The vocalist's blackened eyelids drooped to the
paper that she held;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Some folks want power and riches, and really will not<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be denied,<br />
  And when they've accomplished their object, they are<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very far from satisfied;<br />
  A fig for your wealth and your power, for riches I care<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a jot;<br />
  Contented am I&mdash;yes! and happy&mdash;I'm quite satisfied<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my lot.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Inappropriate," said Rosalind under her
breath, "isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The vocalist looked up again, for now she knew
the words;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'I'm not tired of England, I've no wish to roam,<br />
  There's a little six-roomed house that's my home, sweet home;<br />
  My house is my castle&mdash;who is my pride and joy?<br />
  Why! his Royal Highness the King of the Castle, my little baby boy.'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When she had shrilled the chorus times without
number she withdrew, and Conrad said,
</p>

<p>
"Can't we go and sit further back where
we can talk?  Look at all those chairs over
there."
</p>

<p>
"If you like.  What do you think of her?"
</p>

<p>
"She can't sing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's a detail.  But she doesn't <i>work</i>
the song."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you feel what she ought to do?  Well,
of course you wouldn't!  'His Royal Highness
the King' line ought to bring the house down.
Wouldn't <i>I</i> make it 'go!'"
</p>

<p>
"Show me," he begged.  "There's nobody
looking."
</p>

<p>
So in the corner that they had found, she
hummed the bars, and showed him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, aren't you clever!" he exclaimed.
"What a pretty voice you have!  Perhaps
you're&mdash;er&mdash;fond of babies?"
</p>

<p>
"If you mean 'have I got any children?' no,
I haven't.  That was an actress, not a mother.
I've no ring on&mdash;did you think I was married?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you looked so very devoted, I wondered
for a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Are <i>you</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly," said Conrad, gazing at her.
</p>

<p>
"'Suddenly'&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"Devoted."
</p>

<p>
"I meant 'married,'" she explained.
</p>

<p>
"I?" he said.  "Good heavens!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't be so astonished!&mdash;such a thing has
happened to men."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I'm not a marrying man."
</p>

<p>
"I think most men say they aren't marrying
men till they say, 'Will you marry me?'  It's a
pity they change their mind so often."
</p>

<p>
"I have pitied them myself."
</p>

<p>
"Them?" she said.  "The girls, you mean!
A man begins to be in love much sooner than a
woman, but he finishes much sooner too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's why marriage was invented,"
said Conrad.  "The man brings the fervour, and
the woman brings the faithfulness.  You can't
combine better qualities."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and what about his fervour afterwards?
He wants to go and be in love all over again.
Haven't I seen?  In this profession, travelling
about, a girl often meets a good fellow; I don't
say he's often rich&mdash;the ones who mean well are
generally hard up.  Perhaps he's a clerk, or
something, in the town.  He's taken with her from the
'front,' and gets to know her.  Then he waits for
her at the stage door every evening, and sees her
home, and makes her talk 'shop'&mdash;he always
makes her talk 'shop,' that's the fascination to
him.  After she goes away, he writes to her, and
by-and-by perhaps they marry.  They do sometimes.
Of course she's to leave the stage; he generally
asks for that&mdash;the kind of man I'm talking
about.  Well, what's the result?"
</p>

<p>
"She's sorry she gave it up."
</p>

<p>
"No, she isn't.  There are exceptions&mdash;don't
I know it! but in most cases she's only too thankful
to give it up.  There's no glamour about it for
the girl&mdash;<i>she</i> has lived all that out; the 'little
six-roomed house and home sweet home' is the
only ambition she has left.  It's the man who
finds the marriage dull.  He was in love with being
in love with an actress.  He liked waiting for that
smile over the footlights&mdash;about the middle of
the first verse of her solo; it flattered him to know
he was the one man in all the audience who was
going to talk to her directly.  When they're
married she's just an ordinary girl&mdash;like Miss Smith,
and Miss Brown, and the other girls he knew.
The fairy has lost her wings.  She's a very good
little wife perhaps, but just a drab little mortal.
He says, 'How romantic it used to be when she
was a fairy!'&mdash;and goes fairy-catching outside
another stage-door."
</p>

<p>
"Poor little mortal!"
</p>

<p>
"Men want romances.  When you find them
out, the most unlikely men are romantic; but when
you find them out, nine hundred and ninety women
in a thousand are domesticated."
</p>

<p>
"Are <i>you</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"There are the other ten," laughed Rosalind....
"And I'm not talking of society women&mdash;of
course I don't know anything about them; I'm
talking of every-day women, and us.  Look at my
friend!  I suppose you'd take her for a bohemian
through and through?  She has had to earn her
living in the Profession since she was sixteen, and
she's slangy, and she'd shock your sort of woman
out of her wits.  Marriage is the last thing she
thinks of now.  But let a man she liked come
along!  She'd marry him on two pounds a week,
and go through fire and water for him, and thank
heaven for the joy of hanging up the washing in
her own back yard."
</p>

<p>
Miss Lascelles, with a hint of coon steps, was
singing&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'What is the use of loving a girl<br />
  When you know she don't want yer <i>to</i>?'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have thought it," said Conrad.
"She doesn't suggest domesticity in back yards."
</p>

<p>
"Does she suggest a boarding-school for young
ladies?"
</p>

<p>
His eyebrows asked a question.
</p>

<p>
"There was a time when Tattie was among little
girls who walked two and two in Kensington."
</p>

<p>
"Really?  Do you know that hurts, rather?
I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i>'m sorry," sighed Rosalind.  "But her
heart's sweet," she added; "it's only the bloom
that has gone."  She smiled.  "Clap your hands!
She's my pal&mdash;you've got to applaud her."
</p>

<p>
"She's very good," he said, applauding.  "I
thought she was going to do a flower song?  But
I like that one.  Isn't it pretty?  I like the way
it goes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, rag-time&mdash;all against the beat.  <i>Don't</i>
hum it out of tune!" she said plaintively.  "She's
going to do the flower song next.  By-the-bye, I
may have to introduce you to some of the girls.
What shall I call you?"
</p>

<p>
"My <i>name</i>," Conrad answered deferentially,
"is 'Warrener.'"
</p>

<p>
She bent her head;
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Lady Darlington.
</p>

<p>
When the concert was over he walked with her
as far as Mrs. Cheney's.  Tattie of course was
with them.  At the foot of the steps Tattie shook
hands with him and went indoors, and he remained
a minute saying 'good night' to Rosalind.
The other girl might well have heard all they
said, but the minute had charm to him because
the other girl had left them.  It implied
something.  And underneath, to both these shuttlecocks
of temperament, there was another charm,
not defined yet&mdash;to be savoured in the first
moments of solitude&mdash;the charm of recapturing a
mood of years ago.  At a doorstep, late: "You
look tired?"  "Oh, it's nothing."  A pause.
"I shall see you to-morrow?"  "Yes, come in to
tea."  A whiff of the fragrance of his youth, a
touch of the sentimentality of her girlhood,
idealised Corporation Road as they parted in the fog.
</p>

<p>
"I wish it were to-morrow! ... Good night."
</p>

<p>
"Do you? ... Good night."
</p>

<p>
The old tune was not classical, but it was
pretty.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
"I want something substantial," said Conrad
gravely, shaking his head.  "For the follow, say
a Chateaubriand."
</p>

<p>
Two days had passed, and in his mind a new
and disquieting thought had risen&mdash;the thought
that Rosalind couldn't pay for enough to eat.
</p>

<p>
Truly she was paying for a great deal to eat,
conjuring steaks and puddings on to the tables of
a dozen lodgings, and inventing strange stories
to account for her having half-sovereigns to lend.
But Conrad could not know that.  He only knew
that the necessities of the <i>Kiss-and-Tell</i> Company
were more urgent than he had understood; and
he felt very sorry for all the girls, but his heart
bled for Lady Bountiful.
</p>

<p>
"A Chateaubriand," he repeated firmly.  It was
nourishing.  "And pommes soufflées....  No?
Well, I'll leave the potatoes to you.  With a
chestnut purée, eh?  And let us have nice sweets.
Don't give me the table d'hôte sweets&mdash;special.
What about peaches? ... Well, send for the
best fruit you can get&mdash;you've plenty of time.
Where's the wine-list?  A quarter to two.  That
table in the corner&mdash;for three persons."
</p>

<p>
There is one place in Blithepoint where the
chef can cook, though he shirks pommes soufflées.
You go downstairs to it&mdash;unless you choose the
hotel entrance&mdash;and it was in the restaurant
downstairs that Conrad ordered the luncheon on
Monday.  He meant to say things at luncheon.
But when Rosalind and Tattie arrived, there was
a bomb-shell with the hors d'oeuvres.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Quisby has bolted!" they cried, taking
their seats.
</p>

<p>
"Bolted?" he echoed.  "How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Queenie Vavasour and Miss Jinman have
been to his rooms this morning.  They went to tell
him they must have some money.  He has gone,
he went last night&mdash;with our concert sixpences."
</p>

<p>
"I say!" exclaimed Conrad.  He was by this
time almost a member of the Company.  "What
are we all going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a nice fix," continued Rosalind, reproachfully.
"I told you this would happen, I never
thought he'd be able to take us on anywhere
else&mdash;never for a moment.  Didn't I warn you?"
</p>

<p>
"You did," said Conrad.  "Oh!  I admit it.
Will you have a sardine, or&mdash;&mdash;?  Miss
Lascelles, let me give you some of the pretty ones
with the red and yellow."
</p>

<p>
"I told you all along," repeated Rosalind,
"that girls could do nothing for themselves in a
matter like that; that it needed a man to take it
up.  Now, didn't I say so?"
</p>

<p>
"You said so several times.  But you didn't
suggest what I should do.  I couldn't menace
him with a revolver."
</p>

<p>
"Men are so lazy!" she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You may smile," said Conrad reprovingly,
"but it's very serious for us.  We are all out of
an engagement."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she agreed.  "And goodness only
knows when you'll get one again!"
</p>

<p>
"That's sheer spite&mdash;you're jealous of my
talent.  Miss Lascelles, tell her I can't be out of
an engagement long."
</p>

<p>
"With all his experience?" cried Tattie.
"His notices as 'Buttercup' were immense!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Miss Jinman!" sighed Rosalind; "I'm
sorry for that old woman."  She nodded at
Conrad.  "You should see her this morning!"
</p>

<p>
"I want to see her," he declared, "or rather,
I want one of you to see her for me.  You know
we've all got to stick together in this thing,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And 'be loyal to the show!'" said Tattie.
</p>

<p>
"No, but joking aside, I want you girls to help
me straighten things out.  I was going to talk to
you about it anyhow.  Now tell me&mdash;what do
they all want?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose they all want a 'shop,'" Tattie
answered.
</p>

<p>
"I can't give them a 'shop'&mdash;I'm not in the
business&mdash;but I might send them home with a
few of the Best in their pockets.  How would
that do?"
</p>

<p>
They lifted their heads, and looked at him;
and the waiter put the soup on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Did you mean it?" murmured Rosalind when
the waiter had turned his back.
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course.  Now this looks very good;
let's enjoy our lunch!  We seem to be getting on
a bit, so we needn't worry.  Don't you think you
ought to take your jacket off&mdash;you'll be cold
when you go out?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I've loosened it," she said.  "But&mdash;er&mdash;do
you know I'd rather you didn't do that?
I&mdash;I think they could all manage without."
</p>

<p>
"Now, why interfere?" said Conrad peevishly.
"This is my department.  You have
bungled hopelessly yourself.  By your own
showing you distrusted the man&mdash;and you let him
escape, instead of patrolling his doorstep like a
bright young woman.  Then when <i>I</i> bring intelligence
to bear on the matter, and we're all happy,
you must cut in and throw cold water on the
scheme.  Take your soup and be good."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it nice?" said Tattie.
</p>

<p>
"Now that's a sensible remark.  I turn to
<i>you</i>&mdash;we won't be interfered with.  Suppose you
help me, Miss Lascelles?  Will you be Santa
Claus in Corporation Road for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she faltered.  "You had better go
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I?" gasped Conrad; "I wouldn't do it for
a million&mdash;they'd thank me, some people have
got no tact."
</p>

<p>
"They'd cry over you," she said, with tears in
her own voice.  "You don't know what it is
you're doing.  They aren't used to men
who&mdash;  You're a trump!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pickles," he said.  "Where's that
waiter?  I say, we're all being awfully solemn;
I thought this was going to be a jolly party?  Miss
Daintree&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Warrener?"
</p>

<p>
"Please talk."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to talk later on," she said.  "I'm
going to talk like a mother to you."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you talk like yourself in the meanwhile?
I don't want anything better."
</p>

<p>
Then she talked like herself; and the plates
were changed, and the hour was pleasurable.  It
was a very uncommon hour, because her friend
was so nice.  The pretty girl's friend is nearly
always an infliction, and makes mischief
afterwards because she hasn't been sufficiently
admired.  It was such a pleasurable hour that
Conrad knew a pang of regret in reflecting that there
would be few more like it&mdash;Rosalind, no doubt,
would flee from Blithepoint as soon as the other
women.  Would he meet her again?  Of course
she would drift into another Company; meet
another man in another town.  Damn!
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to miss that girl," he mused, "and
know she's flirting with somebody else while I'm
remembering her!"
</p>

<p>
"'The world,'" he exclaimed, indulging his
weakness for quotation, "'is a comedy to those
that think, a tragedy to those who feel!'"  And
neither Rosalind nor Tattie found it needful to
inquire to which category he was assigning
himself; there may be sentimental seconds even over
a chateaubriand.  He added, "Let me fill up
that glass for you&mdash;you've nothing there but froth."
</p>

<p>
It was more than half-past three when the
waiter abased himself in letting them out, and as
they turned along the Parade, Tattie recollected
that she had "promised to be with Miss Vavasour
at four."  They all stopped for a minute, and
Conrad tried to look as if he didn't want her to
go.  However she went, and he and Rosalind
sauntered on without her.
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" he said.  "Shall we go
and hear the band?"
</p>

<p>
"There isn't one in the afternoon this time of
year."
</p>

<p>
"Not in the band-stand, but I think there is on
the pier.  The band-stand is retained chiefly as
a rendezvous, I believe.  When he says 'Where
will you meet me this evening?' she always says
'Opposite the band-stand.'"
</p>

<p>
Rosalind replied, "How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I gather it.  Pensive figures watch the clock,
and look up and down.  They all turn hopefully
when they hear you, and scowl at you as you come
in sight.  I passed once in the evening; I felt
myself such a general disappointment that I
always walk on the other side now."
</p>

<p>
The man at the turnstiles told them that the
orchestra was playing in the theatre; and as they
drew close they heard it, but for some little time
they could find no way inside.  No charge was
made for admission to the theatre in the
afternoon, and only the entrance to the balcony was
open.  They saw nobody to guide them.  There
were no other footsteps on the pier; there was
no sound but the plaintive music that they couldn't
reach.  They wandered round and round the
terrace, trying locked doors.
</p>

<p>
The tide was out, and the sheen of the smooth
wet sand was violet under a paling sky.  Little
white waves were hurrying, and in the faded
distance the star of the lightship gleamed and hid.
</p>

<p>
Through the window of an unexpected office
they spied the girl who sold the stall tickets in
the evening.  "Oh, yes!" she said, and ran out
to show them where to go.
</p>

<p>
Only two or three figures inhabited the roomy
balcony.  Below, the body of the house was
soulless, shrouded in white wrappers.  Faint
daylight touched the auditorium wanly, but gas jets
yellowed the faces of the orchestra.  In the
narrow line of glare amid the emptiness, they
played.
</p>

<p>
Rosalind and Conrad sat down in the last row,
and spoke in low voices.  He knew that the
impression of the scene was going to linger with
him after she had gone.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes she whispered, "Let's go
on the terrace again," and they crept to the door.
</p>

<p>
"We couldn't talk in there," she said....
"Look here! what you were saying to Tattie:
I want you to tell me straight, I don't know
anything about you&mdash;can you afford to do all
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," he said; "that's all right."
</p>

<p>
"But really?  Tell me the truth.  How well
off are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well! ... I'm very well off."
</p>

<p>
"Because if you're going to miss the money,
there's another way out, that's why.  I shouldn't
forgive myself if I put you in a hole; I bar that
sort of thing.  Lunch and flowers are all very
well, but the other's rather steep."
</p>

<p>
"I sha'n't miss the money."
</p>

<p>
"Honour bright?"
</p>

<p>
"Honour bright!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, then!  It's awfully good of you,
I sha'n't forget it," she said.  "'Warrener' is
really your name, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you understood that at the time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, "I did.  I only wondered
for a moment&mdash;I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's nothing," he answered....  "You
know what I want you to tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"About yourself.  What can I do for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you needn't count me or Tattie.  We
don't want anything."
</p>

<p>
"That's all bosh.  But you don't come in
with the rest&mdash;I want to do more than that for
you.  Treat me as a pal.  You're on the rocks,
and I'm not; I've been there, and I know what
it means.  Let me give you a hundred to set you
right."
</p>

<p>
"You want to give me a hundred pounds?"  She
threw back her astonished face at him&mdash;she
was all white throat and eyes.  "D' ye like me
so much?"
</p>

<p>
"Damnably!" said Conrad.
</p>

<p>
The music had stopped, and now the bandsmen
came hurrying past them.  They stood looking
shoreward, in a pause.  On the dusk of the
Parade the chain of electric globes quivered into
light.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather rough on you," she murmured.
"Isn't it?  I've always drawn the line.  It's
no good."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think it was.  I shouldn't have told
you if you hadn't asked me.  I know; if a man
cared about you, you'd expect him to want to
marry you."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't I?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, why not?  Only I'm one of the men
who aren't designed for husbands.  I could
make a beautiful lover&mdash;while it lasted; a very
staunch friend&mdash;to a man, or a woman&mdash;all
my life; but everybody has his limitations.
Women are just the same.  There are women
who are made to be daughters&mdash;they're perfect
as daughters; but they should never marry.
There are women who're meant for mothers.
<i>They</i> should never marry&mdash;I mean they make
very poor wives.  Not many of us are first-class
all round.  Still that's nothing to do with it.  I
haven't asked you for anything, and I'm not
going to.  If you had been&mdash;different, well, for
my own sake, I should have been very glad!  I
never played 'Faust,' though, everybody's
morality begins somewhere&mdash;it's just my luck that
I've got fond of a girl who <i>isn't</i> 'different.'  But
there it is!  We needn't talk about it.  Put that
aside, and let me help you as if I were your
brother.  I don't feel like your brother, but you
can trust me just as much.  I quite understand.
I'm not vain enough to suppose you like me, but
I quite understand that it would be 'no use' if
you did."
</p>

<p>
She looked beyond him pensively, and pensively
she hummed:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'What is the use of loving a girl<br />
  If the girl don't love you?<br />
  What is the use of loving a girl<br />
  When you know she don't want yer <i>to</i>?'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Don't do that," said Conrad.  "I'm trying
to talk to you like a chum.  If you sing that
song, I shall kiss you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want me to say?" she
asked, strolling on.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to say anything.  You'll
get the money for the others in the morning, and
I'll send you the hundred during the day."
</p>

<p>
"You're not to!" she exclaimed.  "I don't
need it, I swear I don't.  You're not to send
Tattie or me a shilling.  If you do, I'll send it
back."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I don't need it, that's why."
</p>

<p>
"No it isn't.  It's because you don't believe
what I've said.  My dear girl, I don't suppose
I shall ever see you again after you leave here.
When do you go?"
</p>

<p>
"We go to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"You and Tattie?  I mean 'Miss Lascelles'?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'Tattie' doesn't hurt.  Yes, she's going
to stay&mdash;we're going to be together for a little
while."
</p>

<p>
"Where?  Don't you want me to ask?"
</p>

<p>
"London," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any people there?"
</p>

<p>
"No....  The only relation that counts is in
the country now.  Now mind!  You're not to send
anything for us two, or you'll offend me.
Whatever you send will go to the others, all of it."
</p>

<p>
"Have it your own way," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
They walked once round the terrace without
speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Are you angry?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"You've hurt rather.  You've pitched it back
at me.  I don't mean the beastly money, but the
intention.  I think you might have trusted me.
On my honour, I'd have taken no advantage
of it!"
</p>

<p>
After another pause, she said:
</p>

<p>
"I'm a fool to tell you, but I can't help it....
I'm not on the stage any more, I'm not
hard up; I'm&mdash;married."
</p>

<p>
"Married?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been married five years."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" he said.  "Well&mdash;  Not on
the stage?  What are you doing here then?"
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't acting; I only came down to be in
it all again.  I&mdash;" her smile was wistful, "I
was 'trying back'; I wanted to feel as I used
to feel&mdash;I was dull."
</p>

<p>
He nodded comprehension; "Oh yes!  I've
done a lot of 'trying back' myself....  Do you
care for him?"
</p>

<p>
She gave the faintest shrug.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you weren't going away," he sighed.
"I shall often see you again?"
</p>

<p>
"We're the only people left on the pier," said
Rosalind.  "Don't you think we're having more
than our twopenn'orth?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall go to town on Wednesday," he told
her, as they turned homeward.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you?"
</p>

<p>
"You haven't answered what I asked you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said.  "Besides you'll
soon forget that you wanted to."
</p>

<p>
"If I don't forget?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;  You may write to me."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll post you a line before I leave," she
promised.  "We shall leave as early as we
can&mdash;as soon as we've done your business for you;
I sha'n't see you before I go.  By-the-bye, I don't
know if you're staying at the hotel where we
lunched?&mdash;there'll be letters for you from the
Company to-morrow, too."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm at the Grand," he said.  "My
Christian name is 'Conrad.'"
</p>

<p>
It seemed a very short distance to Corporation
Road.  It seemed untrue that it was only four
days since he had stood at the door with her for
the first time.  They went up the steps, and she
did not turn the knob.
</p>

<p>
"Are you coming in?" she murmured.  "I
daresay Tattie is back."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know I think I'd rather say 'au
revoir' to you alone."
</p>

<p>
"Au revoir," she said.  Her hand was formal.
He was rather chilled.
</p>

<p>
"You mean to post me that line?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  And then in the darkness of the
doorway, she laughed, and began to hum the song
that he had warned her not to sing.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
He found the evening very long.  He was restless.
The memory of her kiss was exquisite, but
it did not make for repose.  It seemed to him
intolerably stupid that he was boring himself in
the billiard-room of the Grand when Corporation
Road was so near.  Still she had taken leave of
him&mdash;if he went he might be unwelcome to her,
she might be disappointing to him.
</p>

<p>
Early next afternoon he received the line she
had promised.  It arrived with letters from the
Company.  They were such deeply grateful
letters that they hurt him a little when he read
them, but he guessed which was hers, and he
opened that one first.  Mixed with the pleasure
with which he opened it there was the curiosity,
even the&mdash;he would have refused to acknowledge
it&mdash;even the slight touch of apprehension
with which a man who likes a woman better than
he knows her always opens her first letter.
</p>

<p>
He smiled&mdash;he heard her speaking.
</p>

<p>
"If you ever write, the address is 'Miss Tattie
Lascelles, c/o Madame Hermiance, 42 bis Great
Titchfield Street, W.'  You understand?  You
aren't to put my name on the outside envelope
at all.  Blithepoint is blessing you.&mdash;R.D."
</p>

<p>
If he ever wrote, did she say?  By his halidom
he was going to write immediately!  His impulse
was to beg her to dine with him, but probably
she would find it easier to meet him during the
day.  Luncheon then.  But where?  The choice
of a restaurant bothered him&mdash;she might be
afraid of acquaintances seeing her.  He bethought
himself of the Café Anonyme in Soho, and
entreated her to lunch with him on Thursday at
two o'clock.  As a postscript he scribbled, "You
won't say you can't, will you?  If I don't hear
from you, I shall be waiting for you at the door."  To
enable her to reply, though he prayed that
no reply would come, he added that he should
stay at the Carlton.
</p>

<p>
He was glad to leave Blithepoint; when the
woman one liked there has gone, a place is always
distressing.  In the train it was agreeable to
reflect that she had read his note by this time.
Again he imagined her as she read it&mdash;looking
down, looking up, putting it in her pocket.  The
little Café Anonyme had been a good idea.  They
would do their best for him there, and their soles
à la Marguery were unequalled in London.  The
private rooms, too, were not unhomely, they hit
the happy medium&mdash;there was no riot of red
velvet and gilding, nor were there rag roses
hanging askew in dusty glass epergnes.  It would
have been unappreciative&mdash;it would have been
an insult&mdash;to ask Rosalind to be made love to
in a vulgar room.
</p>

<p>
He wandered about the Carlton after dinner
until the last post was delivered, and was relieved
to find there was nothing for him.  He was sure
that if she hadn't meant to go, she would have
declined at once.  She wouldn't raise his hopes
only to dash them to the parquetry as the clock
was preparing to strike; she wouldn't be thoughtless,
unfeeling.  Oh no, she wasn't like that!
</p>

<p>
And there was no letter on Thursday either,
and he sallied to Soho with delight.
</p>

<p>
The exterior of the Café Anonyme when he
reached it looked to him a shade less ingenuous
than it had been, but upstairs all was well.  The
view of the grim houses opposite was screened
by lace, firelight flashed on the Dutch hearth
cheerfully, and the little white table, set for
tête-à-tête, invited confidences.  He forced his
attention upon the menu, and lounged back into the
street.  It was a fine day for London.  The sky
was funereal, and the pavements were muddy, but
there was no rain falling.  He loitered before
the restaurant happily, and glanced at his watch.
At five minutes to two, expectation began to
swell.
</p>

<p>
At two o'clock he couldn't hold back a smile&mdash;at
any instant now her face might irradiate
the blank.  He wondered which way she would
come, and if she would drive, or walk.  He could
see for some distance, both to right and left, and
his only regret was that he couldn't see both
ways at once.  He kept turning his head, fearful
that he might miss a second's joy.
</p>

<p>
There was a leaping moment in which a figure
suggested her as it hove in sight.  The girl proved
offensively plain, and he was furious with her as
she passed.  Somehow he did not rebound from
the mistake&mdash;it was the first fall in the temperature;
the girl had killed his elation.  He watched
now eagerly, but he repressed no smile.
</p>

<p>
She was late.  Oh, of course she would come,
but the fish would be spoilt.  Rather stupid of
her!  There was nothing more irritating than to
have a careful luncheon ruined because a woman
took twenty minutes to tie her veil.  A melancholy
church clock boomed the quarter.  He began
to feel that he was looking a fool, traversing
these twelve paving-stones.  He was annoyed with
her&mdash;he should be at no pains to conceal it!
</p>

<p>
Constantly hansoms rattled into view, with
disappointing people in them.  There appeared to
him discouragement in the gaze of the portier
now, and a pair of loafers outside the public-house
at the corner were taking interest in him....
He supposed she <i>would</i> come?  Into the
tension of his mood there entered the first sick
qualm of doubt.
</p>

<p>
And the church clock boomed again.  Hope was
breathing its last in him.  Annoyance had melted
into despair&mdash;he longed for her too intensely
to be reproachful if she came.  He would rejoice
over her, he would unbutton her gloves, he would
say how pretty her frock was, and that the chef
was delighted to have been given more time!
</p>

<p>
Five-and-twenty minutes to three! ... Well,
he had better see what he had to pay; it was no
use hoping any longer.  Well, just five minutes!&mdash;the
last stake.  If she weren't here then, she
wouldn't come at all; she wouldn't expect him
to wait at the door all day....  "At the door!"&mdash;his
heart stopped&mdash;the words bore suddenly
a new significance.  In Blithepoint "at the door"
might have meant at the door of her lodgings.
Could it be possible she had misunderstood&mdash;had
she thought he would be on the doorstep in
Great Titchfield Street?  No! how could
she? she had told him she was married.  But the
address was Tattie's&mdash;yes, she might have thought
so!  Good heavens! had <i>she</i> been waiting there
for <i>him</i>?  Perspiration broke out on him.  What
was he to do?  Look at the time!&mdash;she had
given him up long ago, she had gone away! ... Oh,
how could she have thought it? he had
named the restaurant! ... Still it was very odd
she hadn't come.  He must find her, he must
explain!  But&mdash;but&mdash;but she was a married
woman, he couldn't go and peal the bell and ask
for her.  Wait a moment, what had she said?
Was she to stay with Tattie, or was Tattie to
stay with her? ... Anyhow Tattie <i>was</i> there.
Yes, he <i>could</i> go&mdash;he could go there and ask
for Tattie!  His head was spinning.  What the
devil had become of all the cabs?
</p>

<p>
Two minutes later the portier had blown his
whistle, and Soho was behind.
</p>

<p>
The pace was reckless, but to Conrad's fevered
stare even the omnibuses seemed to mock his
hansom.  Alternately he threw bribes and
objurgations through the trap.  Where was Great
Titchfield Street hidden?  Were they making a
tour of the West End slums?  The cab jerked
to a stoppage at last, and he leapt out, and
hesitated.  Nothing but shops confronted him.  Had
he forgotten the number&mdash;wasn't it "42 bis?"
The next moment he saw the name, painted
over a window&mdash;"Madame Hermiance, French
Laundress."
</p>

<p>
It was very warm inside.  Three girls, and a
moist loosely clothed woman, whose opulent
bosom was partially concealed, stood at work
behind a long table.  It fluttered with aerial frills
and scraps of pink tissue paper; one of the girls
was folding things up, and making them look
pretty.  He said, "Bonjour, madame," and the
woman said, "Good afternoon, sare."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Lascelles, is she staying here?  Is she in?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, sare, she is gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone?" ejaculated Conrad.
</p>

<p>
"She did lodge 'ere," added the laundress; "I
let 'er a room upstairs; but she go away&mdash;she get
an engagement.  You mean an actress, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," he said, "I know all about the
engagement, but she came back.  She came back
the day before yesterday, didn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Mais non, monsieur."  She shook her head.
"She is not come back."
</p>

<p>
"Damn," he faltered.  "Er&mdash;but there was
a letter sent here for her&mdash;it must have been
delivered yesterday morning.  What has become
of the letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, letters?"  She banged an iron about a
shirt with double cuffs; perturbed as he was, he
shuddered to see the havoc she was wreaking.
</p>

<p>
"Mees Lascelles 'as writ me a post carte&mdash;she
ask if 'er letters come, I send 'em on.  I zink she
gives up ze <i>théâtre</i>, I zink she takes a situation
wiz a lady of title.  Julie!" she called; "zat
letter zat come yesterday for Mees Lascelles, it
go to ze post, hein?"
</p>

<p>
"J'-n'-sais-<i>pas</i>!" called Julie.  She sent a
button flying off a waistcoat without turning a hair.
</p>

<p>
"Ameliarran?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes'm?"
</p>

<p>
"Ze letter for Mees Lascelles, where ees it?"
</p>

<p>
"There yer are!" replied "Ameliar Ann."  She
was sewing a red cotton hieroglyphic into a
customer's "tying bow"&mdash;near one of the ends.
Her nod indicated a shelf piled with packages,
and Conrad perceived his letter lying neglected
among the washing.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Madame Hermiance.  "Alors, I
post it to-night myself."
</p>

<p>
"But this is no trifling matter," exclaimed
Conrad, trembling with rage.  "Miss Lascelles
may lose a very large salary through this.  That's
a business letter&mdash;from an impresario.  It should
have been forwarded without delay."
</p>

<p>
"Tiens!" said Madame Hermiance calmly.
"Julie! pack up ze collars."
</p>

<p>
He tramped across the shop, and the three
girls' heads turned to the left.  This much was
certain: Rosalind had said that she and Tattie
would be together.  Sheer babble, that about the
situation!  If the note reached Tattie at once,
there was hope yet.  He strode back, and the
three girls' heads turned to the right.
</p>

<p>
"Madame!"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur?"
</p>

<p>
"I must apologise for occupying your time,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ça ne fait rien," said the laundress.  "Julie! pack
up ze shirts."
</p>

<p>
"But I want you to do me a kindness&mdash;I
want you to be good enough to send the letter
to Miss Lascelles now, by a messenger.  I
suppose it won't take very long?"
</p>

<p>
"Mais, monsieur, I 'ave nobody to send."
</p>

<p>
"Well, but my dear lady," he said&mdash;and
talked to her persuasively of paying for the
service and the hansom that was outside.
</p>

<p>
"Alors!" said Madame Hermiance.
</p>

<p>
Expectancy bubbled in him anew.  He would
scrawl a line explaining what he had suffered,
beseeching Rosalind to meet him still!  Would
Madame have the kindness to provide him with
an envelope?
</p>

<p>
It was provided.
</p>

<p>
And a sheet of note-paper? he was abased by
the trouble he was causing her.
</p>

<p>
Alas! her note-paper was not in the shop, but
she could offer him a price-list&mdash;it was very
long, and the back was blank.
</p>

<p>
This was no moment to finick; the case was
urgent.  He put his foot on a laundry basket,
and the price-list on his knee; and at the back
of "Blouses," "Bodices" and "White petticoats
from 6d," he pencilled his appeal.
</p>

<p>
When "Ameliarran" had cast off her apron,
he promised her a sovereign to buy feathers.  She
was given the post-card bearing the address, and
he let her depart without a question.  It was
evident now that Rosalind had withheld her
address very deliberately; to ascertain where she
lived wouldn't be playing the game!  But would
the appeal find her at home?  She might be
shopping, visiting, taking an aimless, fatal walk!
Hope tottered in him again.  The girls who
remained eyed him sympathetically; he was
conscious that they placed no credence in his
narrative of the impresario, and he withdrew to wait
where he would be less interesting.
</p>

<p>
The street was not picturesque; for the scene
of a lover's impatience it might be called
"preposterous."  The narrow pavements were so busy
that he was forced to choose the narrow road;
and the road was made narrower by stalls of
vegetables and tin pots.  "Ameliarran," he had
heard, might accomplish her mission in half an
hour.  He escaped from the marketing, and lit
a cigar in a grey thoroughfare of comparative
seclusion.
</p>

<p>
"Would she be at home?"  When he turned
back he braced himself to meet the crisis.  He
had consulted his watch frequently, but he had
not returned before "Ameliarran" might be
expected.  Nevertheless he was too soon.  He
withdrew again, and fumed once more among the
cabbages and pans.
</p>

<p>
The next time he was not too soon.  He found
her in the shop, and she had a note for him.
From Rosalind, or Tattie?  Rosalind! he knew
the writing.  Let the girls gape! he wasn't
going outside to read it among the vegetables.
He opened it with elaborate listlessness.  She
had not protracted his pain while she framed
graceful messages.  Her response consisted of
eight words; but they sufficed:
</p>

<p>
"Wait at the laundry.  Throwing on my hat."
</p>

<p>
He doubled the girl's sovereign, and drove
no bargain with her mistress.  But the laundry
cooped him now.  He closed the door, and
loitered gratefully on the step.  Yes, indeed, he
would wait; in the sweetness of relief he was
scarcely impatient.  A little drizzle was in the
air, but he did not heed it.  The day, and the
morrow, and a hundred days broke into smiles
before him.  And while he lingered there&mdash;on
the laundress's step, in the squalid street, under
the rain&mdash;Conrad suddenly awoke to the exhilaration
that sparkled in him, was startled by its
freshness.  He realised that fizzing in his pulses
and his mind was the zest, the buoyancy that he
had mourned as dead.  It was here, alive!  He
reviewed with gusto his emotions of the afternoon,
the hope, the suspense, the desperation&mdash;the
quiver of rejoicing.  It had been good! he
had lived and felt this afternoon; he would not
have abated those emotions by a jot!  The
immoral truth was clear to him, he had made his
great discovery&mdash;that a man is young as often
as he falls in love.  That Rosalind had beauty,
was an irrelevance.  Again, to her lover a woman
<i>is</i> what she makes <i>him feel</i>.  Whether she is fair
or ill-favoured, whether she is worthy or worthless,
whether she is formed like Venus, or clasps
him in arms as thin as penholders, to him she is
supreme, and while he adores her he is Young.
</p>

<p>
The rain was pattering more smartly, and he
waited under his umbrella.  Exultation was in his
heart, her promise was in his pocket, ten years
of his age had been shed behind the door.  And
at this point it may be discreet of us to take
leave of Conrad&mdash;as Rosalind's cab comes
jingling round the corner.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
